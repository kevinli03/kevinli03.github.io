We can define a set by either listing every element out, or through describing the properties of the elements of the set.\n\nFor example, \\(A = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\), or, \\(A=\\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}: 1 ≤ n ≤ 5\\}\\) - or in other words, \\(A\\) is the set of values of \\(n\\) is in the set of all integers \\(Z\\), such that \\(n\\) is between 1 and 5 inclusive.\n\n\n\nHere are some common notation for sets:\n\nIf two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have the same elements, they are equal: \\(A = B\\).\nIf \\(a\\) is an element of set \\(A\\), we use the notation: \\(a \\in A\\).\nIf \\(a\\) is not an element of set \\(A\\), we use the notation: \\(a \\notin A\\).\nIf all elements of set \\(A\\) are also within set \\(B\\), then it is considered a subset, and notated \\(A \\subseteq B\\).\nIf \\(A \\subseteq B\\), but \\(A ≠ B\\), then \\(A\\) is a proper subset of \\(B\\), notated: \\(A \\subset B\\).\n\n\n\nSet Operations\nThere are a few common operations of sets:\n\nThe union of sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), notated \\(A \\cup B\\), is the set of elements that belong to either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\). For example, if \\(A = \\{1,2,3\\}, B = \\{3,4,5\\}\\), then \\(A \\cup B = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\).\nThe intersection of sets, notated \\(A \\cap B\\), is the set of elements that belong to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). For example, if \\(A = \\{1,2,3\\}, B = \\{3,4,5\\}\\), then \\(A \\cap B = \\{3\\}\\).\nThe cardinality of a set \\(A\\) is the number of elements within set \\(A\\), and is notated \\(|A|\\). For example, if \\(A = \\{1,2,3\\}\\), then \\(|A| = 3\\). An empty set is a set with a cardinality of 0, or in other words, with no elements. It is notated with \\(\\varnothing\\)\n\n\n\nTypes of Sets and Notation\nA infinite set is one with infinitely many elements. Common examples of infinite sets include:\n\nSet of all natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N} = \\{1,2,3,...\\}\\).\nSet of all integers \\(\\mathbb{Z} = \\{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ... \\}\\).\nSet of all real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), which is any number on the real number line.\n\nThe set of all real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is the most common used set. A subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is called an interval, and can be notated with either brackets or parentheses as follows:\n\nClosed interval: \\([a,b] = \\{  x \\in \\mathbb{R} | a ≤ x ≤ b \\}\\)\nOpen interval: \\((a, b) = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}|a &lt; x &lt; b \\}\\)\nWe can also mix closed and open intervals: \\([a, b) = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}|a≤x&lt;b\\}\\)\n\nIn all these intervals, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are called endpoints of the interval. Any point inside of an interval that is not an endpoint is an interior point.\n\n\n\n\nSolving Equations\n\nSolving Equations with One Variable\nTo solve an equation with one variable, we look to isolate the variable on one side. We can do this by either adding/subtracting to both sides of the equation, or multiplying/dividing the equation on both sides by the same value.\nExample: Solve for \\(x\\) in the equation: \\(\\frac{x+3}{4} = 6\\)\n\nMultiply both sides by 4: \\(4 \\left( \\frac{x+3}{4}\\right) = 6 \\times 4\\)\nSimplify to get: \\(x+3 - 24\\)\nNow, subtract 3 from both sides: \\(x+3 - 3 = 24 -3\\)\nThus, we get \\(x = 21\\)\n\n\n\nSolving Inequalities\nSolving inequalities is the same as solving equations (for both one variable, and more, as we will see later). There is only one difference: if we multiply both sides by a negative number, we flip the direction of the inequality sign.\n\n\nSolving System of Equations\nTo solve a system of equations (such as 2 different equations with 2 variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)), we do the following procedure:\n\nWith one of the equations, solve for one of the variables (either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) generally)\nSubstitute that equation that we just solved, into the other equation. This will make that equation only have one variable. Solve that equation for the remaining variable.\nThen, plug the variable we have found, into either of the original equations, and find the value of the other variable.\n\nThe solution to a system of equations is also the point where the two lines meet on a graph.\nExample: Solve the system of equations: \\(3x + 2y = 13\\), \\(x - 2y = 3\\).\n\nFirst, solve one of the equations for one of the variables.\n\nLet us take \\(x - 2y = 3\\). We can solve for \\(x\\) to get: \\(x = 2y+3\\)\n\nNow, plug the equation we just got into the other equation\n\nThe other equation is \\(3x + 2y = 13\\). Plug in the \\(x\\) we found: \\(3(2y+3) + 2y = 13\\)\n\nNow, solve that equation for the remaining variable:\n\n\\(3(2y+3)+2y = 13 \\Longrightarrow 6y + 9 +2y = 13 \\Longrightarrow 8y = 4 \\Longrightarrow y = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nNow, plug \\(y\\) back into either equation to find \\(x\\):\n\n\\(x = 2y+3\\) that we solved for earlier. Plug in \\(y\\) to get \\(x =2(\\frac{1}{2}) +3 = 4\\)\n\n\nThus, the solution to the system of equations is \\(x=4, y = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\n\n\n\nFactoring and Expansion\nFactorisation is the process of changing an equation from the form \\(ax^2+bx+c\\) to the form \\((x+i)(x+j)\\). To do this, we need to:\n\nFind 2 numbers \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), that sum to \\(b\\), and multiply to \\(c\\)\nOnce we have done that, simply put it into the form \\((x+i)(x+j)\\)\n\nExample: Factor \\(x^2 + 5x + 6\\)\n\nWe need to find two numbers \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), that add to 5, and multiply to 6.\n\\(2\\) and \\(3\\) are two numbers that add to 5, while multiplying to 6.\nNow, put it into the factored form: \\((x+2)(x+3)\\)\n\n \nThere is a special form of factoring: difference of squares.\n\nEssentially, any expression that takes the form of \\(a^2 - b^2\\) can be rewritten as \\((a+b)(a-b)\\).\nFor example: \\(x^2 - 9 = (x+3)(x-3)\\).\n\n \nMultiplication expansion undoes factoring. To do this, we must multiply each term of one section by each other term of the other section. This is more intuitive with an example.\nExample: let us prove the difference of squares idea we saw earlier - multiply out \\((x+3)(x-3)\\): \\[\n\\begin{split}\n(x+3)(x-3) & = (x \\times x) + (x \\times -3) + (3 \\times x) + (3 \\times -3) \\\\\n& = x^2 - 3x + 3x -9 \\\\\n&= x^2 - 9\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nSo we can see, that indeed, difference of squares is true, and \\(x^2 - 9 = (x+3)(x-3)\\).\n\n\nExponents and Logarithms\n\nExponents\nHere are a few key properties of exponents that are important to note:\n\n\\(a^x \\times a^y = a^{x+y}\\) and \\(a^x / a^y = a^{x-y}\\)\n\\(a^{-x} = \\frac{1}{a^x}\\)\n\\((a^x)^y = a^{xy}\\)\n\\(a^0 = 1\\)\n\\((a \\times b)^n = a^n \\times b^n\\) and \\((a/b)^n = a^n / b^n\\)\n\nSometimes, you will have an equation that takes the form \\(x^n = a\\), where \\(n\\) is some number.\nHow to get rid of \\(n\\) to isolate \\(x\\)?\n\nWe know that \\(n \\times (1/n) = 1\\).\nWe also know that \\((a^x)^y = a^{xy}\\). Thus: \\[\n\\begin{split}\n& (x^n)^{(1/n)} = a^{(1/n)} \\\\\n& x^{n \\times (1/n)} =x^1 = x = a^{(1/n)} \\\\\n& \\text{thus}, x = a^{1/n}\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\n\n\nLogarithms\nLogarithms are the inverse for exponential functions. The relationship is as follows:\n\\[\ny = \\log_a(x) \\Longrightarrow a^y = x\n\\]\nOr more intuitively, take the example \\(y = \\log_2(8)\\) is basically asking, what power \\(y\\) should I take base 2 to, in order to get an answer of \\(8\\).\n\nOf course, \\(2^3 = 8\\), so the answer is \\(y=3\\).\n\nHere are a few key properties to know about logarithms.\n\n\\(\\log(xy) = \\log(x) + \\log(y)\\) and \\(\\log(x/y) = \\log(x) - \\log(y)\\)\n\\(\\log(x^y) = y \\times \\log(x)\\)\n\\(-\\log(x) = \\log(1/x)\\)\n\\(\\log(1) = \\log(e^0) = 0\\)\n\nNote that in statistics, when we say \\(\\log(x)\\), we are talking about natural logs (base \\(e\\)). We will specify any other base with a subscript in the logarithm. We can change the base of logarithms with the following formula:\n\\[\n\\log_b(x) = \\frac{\\log_a(x)}{\\log_a(b)}\n\\]\n\n\n\nSummation and Product Notation\n\nSummation Notation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Definition: Summation Notation\n\n\n\nSummation Notation is a way of expressing the sums of many values:\n\\[\n\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n x_i = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n\n\\]\n\n\\(i = 1\\) indicates that we start summing from index \\(i=1\\), or basically, we start with \\(x_1\\).\n\\(n\\) is the value of the index at which we stop summing. This is often the sample size.\n\\(x_i\\) is the value of an element within set \\(X = \\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \\}\\) with index \\(i\\). For example, is \\(i = 1\\), \\(x_i = x_1\\), the first element in set \\(X\\).\n\n\n\nSummation notation has a few properties:\n\n\\(\\sum cx_i = c \\times \\sum x_i\\), where \\(c\\) is some constant.\n\\(\\sum (x_i + y_i) = \\sum x_i + \\sum y_i\\)\n\\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n c = n \\times c\\), where \\(c\\) is some constant.\n\n\n\nProduct Notation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Definition: Product Notation\n\n\n\nProduct notation is a way of expressing the products of many values:\n\\[\n\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n x_i = x_1 \\times x_2 \\times ... \\times x_n\n\\]\n\n\\(i = 1\\) indicates that we start multiplying from index \\(i=1\\), or basically, we start with \\(x_1\\).\n\\(n\\) is the value of the index at which we stop multiplying.

    "text": "Pre-Calculus Topics\n\nFunctions and the Cartesian Plane\n\nFunctions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Definition: Functions\n\n\n\nWe have two sets, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). A function \\(f : X \\rightarrow Y\\) is some rule, which assigns each element \\(x \\in X\\) to one, and only one element \\(y = f(x) \\in Y\\).\n\nFor every input \\(x \\in X\\), we must only have one output \\(y \\in Y\\). If we have two outputs, that is not a function.\n\n\n\nThe domain of \\(f\\) is the set of possible values of set \\(X\\). Basically, what values can we input into \\(f(x)\\).\nThe set of possible outputs of function \\(f\\) is the range \\(R(f)\\), and the range must be a subset of the set of \\(Y\\): \\(R(f) \\subseteq Y\\).\nFunctions to not have to only have one input variable. For example, we can have a function \\(f(x,z)\\), with two input values \\(x \\in X\\) and \\(z \\in Z\\), notated \\(f:X,Z \\rightarrow Y\\).\n\nHowever, we once again can only have one output \\(y \\in Y\\) for each different input \\((x,z)\\). If we have multiple outputs for one input, that is not a function.\n\n\n\nCartesian Plane\nRemember that \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is the set of all real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R} = (-∞, ∞)\\). That space is only one dimensional - a single number line. \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) is a 2 dimensional space - essentially two number lines, one perpendicular to the other. Essentially, a graph with \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)-axes. This 2-dimensional space is called a cartesian plane.\nEvery single point in the 2-dimensional cartesian plane can be specified with coordinates \\((a,b)\\), where both \\(a \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). \\(a\\) is the \\(x\\) coordinate, and \\(b\\) is the \\(y\\) coordinate - both who represent the distance from the origin with coordinates \\((0, 0)\\).\nAny real-valued function of one variable can be represented in the \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) space. On the \\(x\\)-axis, we put the input number, and on the \\(y\\)-axis, we put the output of the function. For each input variable value, there must only be one output variable value. Graphically in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\), we can show this:\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, functions can be in more than 2 dimensions. A function with two input variables \\(f(x,z)\\), would be depicted in the 3-dimensional space \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), as \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), \\(z \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), and output \\(f(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). The more input variables, the more dimensions the function is depicted in.\n\n\nCommon Types of Functions\nThere are a few very common types of functions that we will encounter:\n\n\n\n\n\nSlope and Zeroes of Functions\n\nLinear Equations and Slope\nLinear equations take the form \\(f(x) = mx+b\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Definition: Slope\n\n\n\nMore formally, slope is the change in \\(y\\) over the change in \\(x\\), or the amount \\(y\\) changes, for every increase of one unit of \\(x\\).We can calculate the slope between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) as follows:\n\\[\nm = \\Delta y / \\Delta x = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nZeroes and Roots of Functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Definition: Zeroes and Roots\n\n\n\nThe zeroes/roots of a function are the input values of the function that make the output function equal to 0.\n\nMathematically, for what \\(x\\) does \\(f(x) = 0\\).\nGraphically. Since output \\(f(x)\\) is graphed on the \\(y\\)-axis, we can see at what \\(x\\)-values the function cross the line \\(y=0\\) (the \\(x\\)-axis line).\n\n\n\nTo solve for zeroes/roots, simply set the function equal to 0, and solve for \\(x\\).\n\nSome functions can have more than one zero, especially polynomials, and some can have none.\n\nExample: Find the root of \\(f(x) = x -5\\)\n\nSet function output equal to 0: \\(0 = x-5\\)\nSolve for \\(x\\) and we get: \\(x = 5\\).\n\n \nFor quadratic functions, there are two ways to find roots. We can factor, covered in section 1.2.\nExample: Find the root of \\(f(x) = x^2 + 5x +6\\)\n\nSet function output equal to 0: \\(0 = x^2 + 5x + 6\\)\nFactor: \\(0 = (x+2)(x+3)\\)\n\\(x=-2\\) and \\(x=-3\\) make this equation true.\n\nWe can also use the quadratic formula to find the roots of unfactorable equations. Given a quadratic in the form of \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\), the roots are:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b ± \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} }{2a}\n\\]\nNote: we will often have two roots in quadratics (although not always).\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Types of Functions\n\nComposite Functions\nComposite functions are when the output of one function, is used as the input of another function. Composite functions are defined as the following:\n\\[\nf \\circ g = f[g(x)]\n\\]\nEssentially, we calculate the output value of \\(g(x)\\), and immediately input that value into \\(f(x)\\).\nFor example, if \\(h(x) = x^2\\), and \\(f(x) = x-5\\), then \\(f \\circ h = (x^2) - 5\\)\n\nNote, \\(f \\circ h\\) and \\(h \\circ f\\) are different, so make sure you are doing the correct one!\n\n\n\nSurjective, Injective, and Bijective Functions\nA function \\(f:X \\rightarrow Y\\) is a surjective function if its range is equal to the set of \\(Y\\). Mathematically, \\(R(f) = Y\\).\n\nIn other words, for all \\(y \\in Y\\), there exists an \\(x \\in X\\) such that \\(f(x) = y\\).\nFor example: \\(f(x)=x\\) is surjective, as the range of \\(f(x) = x\\) is \\((-∞, ∞)\\), which covers the entire set of \\(Y\\). Thus, \\(R(f) = Y\\).\n\n \nA function \\(f:X \\rightarrow Y\\) is an injective function if distinct inputs are mapped to distinct outputs. Basically, no two input values of \\(x \\in X\\) produce the same value output \\(f(x)\\).\n\nMathematically, for all \\(x_1 \\in X, x_2 \\in X\\), if \\(x_1 ≠ x_2\\), then \\(f(x_1) ≠ f(x_2)\\)\nFor example: \\(f(x) = x\\) is injective, because no two inputs of \\(x\\) produce the same output \\(f(x)\\).\n\n \nA function is bijective if it is both injective and surjective.\n\n\\(f(x) = x\\), as we have shown previously is both injective and surjective, and thus bijective.\n\n\n\nInverse Function\nLet \\(f: X \\rightarrow Y\\) be a bijective function. The sets \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are such that \\(X \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(Y \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\). There is some unique function \\(f^{-1} : Y \\rightarrow X\\), called the inverse function of \\(f\\), which is essentially the opposite of function \\(f\\): when you input the ouputs of \\(f(x)\\) into \\(f^{-1}\\), you get the respective input of \\(f(x)\\).\n\nOr mathematically: \\(y = f(x)\\) if and only if \\(x = f^{-1}(y)\\)\n\nBecause \\(f^{-1}\\) essentially reverses function \\(f(x)\\), the following must be true:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n& f^{-1} (f(x)) = x \\text{ for all } x \\in X \\\\\n& f(f^{-1}(y)) = y \\text{ for all } y \\in Y\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nTo find the inverse function, we simply solve for the input variable.\n \nExample: Find the inverse of \\(f(x) = 2x+3\\)\n\nLet us define \\(y\\) as the output of \\(f(x)\\), such that \\(f(x) = y = 2x+3\\)\nNow, solve for \\(x\\): \\(y = 2x+3 \\Longrightarrow 2x = y-3 \\Longrightarrow x = \\frac{y-3}{2}\\)\n\nLet us prove that this is an inverse function with the properties we showed above. \\[\n\\begin{split}\n& \\text{1st property: }f^{-1} (f(x)) = x \\text{ for all } x \\in X \\\\\n& f^{-1}(y) = \\frac{y-3}{2} \\Longrightarrow f^{-1}(f(x)) = \\frac{(2x + 3) - 3}{2} = \\frac{2x}{2} = x \\\\\n& \\text{2nd property } f(f^{-1}(y)) = y \\text{ for all } y \\in Y \\\\\n& f(x) = 2x +3 \\Longrightarrow f(f^{-1}(y)) = 2\\left( \\frac{y - 3}{2} \\right) + 3=y-3+3 = y\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\n\n\nLimits\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Definition: Limits\n\n\n\nA limit is when a function approaches some specific output value \\(y=f(x) = L\\), as the input \\(x\\) moves closer and closer to some value \\(c\\).\n\nOr more intuitively, as the \\(x\\) value becomes infinitely closer to \\(x=c\\), the \\(y=f(x)\\) value becomes infinitely close to \\(f(x) = L\\).\nLimits are notated with the form: \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x) = L\\)\n\n\n\nFor example, the figure below shows a function with a limit:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a limit to exist, it must approach the same \\(y\\) value \\(L\\), from both sides of \\(x = c\\).\n\nFor example, in the figure above, from both the left and right of \\(x=c\\), the function \\(f(x)\\) approaches L. Thus, a limit exists here.\n\nHowever, if the function were to approach different \\(y\\) values on both sides of \\(x=c\\), then there would be no limit.\n\nWe can notate the limit from the left side of \\(x=c\\) as \\(\\lim\\limits_{x^- \\rightarrow c} f(x) = L\\), and the limit from the right side of \\(x=c\\) as \\(\\lim\\limits_{x^+ \\rightarrow c} f(x) = L\\).\n\nImportantly, \\(f(x)\\) does not need to be defined at point \\(x=c\\) for the limit to exist.\n\nFor example, the figure above has a function \\(y=f(x)\\) that is not defined at \\(f(c)\\), however, the limit still exists.\n\n\nProperties of Limits\nLet us have functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), where \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x) = A\\), and \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x) = B\\). The following properties are thus true:\n\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\rightarrow c} [f(x) + g(x)] = \\lim\\limits_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x) + \\lim\\limits_{x \\rightarrow c} g(x)\\)\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\rightarrow c} [\\alpha \\times f(x) = \\alpha \\times \\lim\\limits_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x)\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is some constant.\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\rightarrow c} [f(x) \\times g(x)] = \\lim\\limits_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x) \\times \\lim\\limits_{x \\rightarrow c}g(x)\\)\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\rightarrow c} [f(x) / g(x)] = \\lim\\limits_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x) / \\lim\\limits_{x \\rightarrow c}g(x)\\)\n\n\n\n\nContinuity\nContinuity as a concept is quite intuitive: if a function has no breaks or jumps within an interval, then it is continuous within that interval.\nWe can express this intuition in more mathematical terms. Suppose that function \\(f\\) has some input interval containing \\(x=c\\). \\(f\\) is continuous at point \\(c\\), given these 2 criteria are both met:\n\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x)\\) exists, i.e. \\(\\lim\\limits_{x^- \\rightarrow c} f(x) = \\lim\\limits_{x^+ \\rightarrow c} f(x)\\).\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x) = f(c)\\).\n\nThese rules make sense intuitively:\n\nThe limit must exist for continuity, since if a function approaches a different \\(Y\\) value on each side at a certain \\(x=c\\), then it cannot be continuous. Thus, the first condition must be true.\nIf the function is not defined at \\(c\\), or is defined by not equal to the limit, that means there will be a break or jump in the function. Thus, the second condition must be true for continuity.\n\n \nLet us assume functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are both continuous at \\(x=c\\). Then, continuity has a few properties:\n\n\\(f(x) + g(x)\\) is continuous at \\(x=c\\).\n\\(f(x) - g(x)\\) is continuous at \\(x=c\\).\n\\(f(x) \\times g(x)\\) is continuous at \\(x=c\\).\n\\(|f(x)|\\)$ is continuous at \\(x=c\\).\n\\(\\alpha \\times f(x)\\) is continuous at \\(x=c\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is some constant.\n\\(f(x) / g(x)\\) is continuous at \\(x=c\\) given \\(g(c) ≠ 0\\).\n\nFinally, if \\(f\\) is continuous in interval \\([a, b]\\), then \\(f\\) must have a maximum and minimum value within \\([a, b]\\)."

    "text": "Derivatives\n\nDefinition of a Derivative\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Definition: Derivative Function\n\n\n\nA derivative function \\(f'\\) outputs the slope (rate of change) of the function of \\(f\\) at any input. So, if we want to know the slope of \\(f\\) at \\(f(a)\\), we would plug \\(a\\) into \\(f'\\).\n \nThe figure shows a function \\(f\\) and a point \\(P\\). The red tangent line shows the slope at point \\(P\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know the definition of slope between two points (from section 1.2) is:\n\\[\n\\Delta y / \\Delta x = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n\\]\nFirst, since we are dealing with functions where output \\(y=f(x)\\), let us replace the \\(y\\)’s in our equation with \\(f(x)\\)’s:\n\\[\n\\Delta y / \\Delta x = \\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}\n\\]\nWe can rewrite \\(x_2\\) and \\(x_1\\) relative to a single point of \\(x\\) as \\(x_1 = x\\) and \\(x_2 = x+h\\). Why? this is because point \\(x_2\\) is just some \\(x\\)-distance away from point \\(x_1\\). Now, let us replace \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) with \\(x\\) and \\(x+h\\):\n\\[\n\\Delta y / \\Delta x = \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{x + h - x} = \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\n\\]\nSo that is essentially another way to rewrite the definition of a slope between two points.\n\nHowever, the issue is, that a derivative is the slope at one point, not between two points. What we have calculated so far is the slope between two points (the secant green line in the figure above).\nWe need the red-tangent line - the slope at one point. How do we calculate the slope at one point?\n\nTo calculate the slope at one point, we can slowly move the two points \\(x\\) and \\(x+h\\) closer and closer to each other.\n\nHow do we do that? With limits (that we covered in section 1.6). By making \\(h\\) smaller and smaller until it approaches 0, the two points will get closer and closer until they are on top of each other, and then, we will have the slope at one point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Definition: Formal Definition of a Derivative\n\n\n\nThus, below is the formal definition of a derivative. We can calculate any derivative with this rule (although, this can become difficult sometimes).\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\lim\\limits_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\n\\]\n\n\nA note on notation: so far, I have used \\(f'\\) (apostrophes) to notate a derivative. We can also use the form \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) to indicate a derivative. We can change \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) in this notation if we are using different variables.\nFinally, it is also possible to take the derivative of a derivative. This is a second-order derivative, and we notate it \\(f''\\) (with two apostrophes).\n\n\n\nRules of Differentiation\nYou can calculate any derivative by plugging it into the formal definition from above. However, this can be tedious and involve a lot of algebra.\nHowever, there are a few generalised forms of functions, whose derivatives are consistent. These rules allow us to quickly calculate derivatives.\n\nNote: these rules are all obtained from the definition of the derivative - they do not magically appear from thin air.\n\n\nStandard Derivatives\nLinear Rule: \\([\\alpha x]' = \\alpha\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is a constant.\nDerivative of a constant: \\([\\alpha]' = 0\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is a constant.\nPower Rule: \\([x^k]' = kx^{k-1}\\), where \\(k\\) is some constant and \\(x^k\\) is a monomial.\nSum Rule: \\([f(x) ± g(x)]' = f'(x) + g'(x)\\).\nConstant Rule: \\([\\alpha \\times f(x)]' = \\alpha \\times f'(x)\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is some constant.\nProduct Rule: \\([f(x) \\times g(x)]' = f'(x) \\times g(x) + f(x) \\times g'(x)\\).\nQuotient Rule: \\([f(x)/g(x)]' = \\frac{f'(x) \\times g(x) + f(x) \\times g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}\\).\nChain Rule: \\([f(g(x))]' = f'[g(x)] \\times g'(x)\\) (used for composite/nested functions).\n\n\nExponential and Log Derivatives\nExponential: \\([e^x]' = e^x\\).\nExponential Nested: \\([e^{u(x)}]' = e^{u(x)} \\times u'(x)\\).\nOther Based Exponentials: \\([b^x]' = \\ln(b) \\times b^x\\).\nNatural Log Derivative: \\([\\ln(x)]' = \\frac{1}{x}\\).\nLog derivative with a power: \\([\\ln(x^k)]' = \\frac{k}{x}\\).\nNested Log Derivative: \\([\\ln(u(x))]' = \\frac{u'(x)}{u(x)}\\)\n\n\nTrigonometric Derviatives\nDerivative of sine: \\([\\sin(x)]' = \\cos(x)\\).\nDerivative of cosine: \\([\\cos(x)]' = -\\sin(x)\\).\n \nExample 1: Find the derivative of \\(f(x) = 5x^4 - 6x^3 + x^2 - 5x + 6\\).\n\nSum rule says that \\(f'(x) = [5x^4]' - [6x^3]' + [x^2]' - [5x]' + [6]'\\)\nConstant rule says that \\(f'(x) = 5[x^4]' - 6[x^3]' + [x^2]' - 5[x] + [6]'\\)\nPower rule says that: \\(f'(x) = 5(4x^3) - 6(3x^2) + (2x) - 5 + 0\\)\nSimplify: \\(f'(x) = 20x^3 - 18x^2 + 2x - 5 + 0\\)\n\n \nExample 2: Find the derivative of \\(f(x) = (x^3)(2x^4)\\).\nTwo methods to do this problem. Method 1 (product rule):\n\nProduct rule says that \\([f(x) \\times g(x)]' = f'(x) \\times g(x) + f(x) \\times g'(x)\\). Let us define \\(f(x) = x^3\\) and \\(g(x) = 2x^4\\).\nLet us find \\(f'(x)\\) and \\(g'(x)\\). Using power rule: \\(f'(x) = 3x^2\\), and \\(g'(x) = 2[x^4]' = 2(4x^3) = 8x^3\\)\nPut it into the product rule form: \\(f'(x) = (3x^2)(2x^4) + (x^3)(8x^3)\\).\nSimplify: \\(f'(x) = 6x^6 + 8x^6 \\Longrightarrow f'(x) =14x^6\\).\n\nMethod 2 (power rule):\n\nSimplify \\(f(x)\\) to get \\(f(x) = 2x^7\\).\nUse constant rule and power rule: \\(f'(x) = 2[x^7]' = 2(7x^6) \\Longrightarrow f'(x) = 14x^6\\)\n\n \nExample 3: Find the derivative of \\(f(x) = (3x^2 + 5x -7)^6\\)\n\nThis is a composite function, so we use chain rule \\([f(g(x))]' = f'[g(x)] \\times g'(x)\\). Let us define \\(f(x) = x^6\\) and \\(g(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 7\\).\nLet us find \\(f'(x)\\) and \\(g'(x)\\). Power rule says \\(f'(x) = 6x^5\\). Sum, constant, and power rule says \\(g'(x) = 6x + 5\\).\nPut it into the form of chain rule: \\(f'(x) = 6(3x^2 + 5x -7)^5 \\times 6x+5\\).\nDistribute out \\(6x+5\\) to get \\(f'(x) = 36x(3x^2+5x-7)^5 + 30(3x^2+5x-7)^5\\).\n\n\n\n\nDerivative of an Inverse Function\nLet \\(f: X \\rightarrow Y\\) be a bijective function \\(y=f(x)\\) (see sections 1.4-1.5). We want to find the derivative of the inverse function \\(f^{-1}: Y \\rightarrow X\\).\nThe simplest way to do this is to find the inverse function (as shown in section 1.5), and calculate the derivative of that.\n\nHowever, the function \\(x = f^{-1}(y)\\) is not always easily differentiable with the rules we have introduced.\nWe can utilise an alternative approach to find inverse derivatives.\n\n \nRemember the identity of inverse functions shown in section 1.5:\n\\[\nf^{-1}(f(x)) = x \\text{ for all } x \\in X\n\\]\nWe know that chain rule says:\n\\[\n[f(g(x))]' = f'[g(x)] \\times g'(x)\n\\]\nWe can define our inverse original \\(f'\\) function as \\(f\\) for the chain rule, and the original \\(f(x)\\) as \\(g(x)\\) for the chain rule.\nThus, using chain rule, we can get the derivative of the identity of inverse functions: \\[\n\\begin{split}\n& f^{-1}(f(x)) = x, \\text{ now differentiate both sides:} \\\\\n& \\frac{df^{-1}(f(x))}{dy} \\times \\frac{df(x)}{dx} = 1, \\text{ since } y = f(x) \\Longrightarrow \\frac{df^{-1}(y)}{dy} \\times \\frac{df(x)}{dx} = 1\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nNow, isolate the derivative of the inverse function to get the derivative of the inverse:\n\\[\n\\frac{df^{-1}(y)}{dy} = \\frac{1}{ \\frac{df(x)}{dx} }, \\text{ and since } y=f(x),x = f(y), \\Longrightarrow \\frac{dx}{dy} = \\frac{1}{ \\frac{dy}{dx} }\n\\]\nWe can use this property to solve for the derivative of the inverse of a function that we do not know how to differentiate with our above rules.\n \nExample: Find the derivative of the inverse function for \\(f(x) = \\ln(x)\\).\n\nFirst, find the inverse \\(f^{-1}(y)\\). We do this by solving for \\(x\\) in \\(y = \\ln(x)\\). Through the definition of logarithms, we know that \\(x = e^y\\). Thus, \\(f^{-1}(y) = e^y\\).\nUsing derivative rules, we know that \\(f'(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\)\nUsing the inverse derivative relationship, we know \\(f'(y) = \\frac{1}{f'(x)}\\).\nThus, \\(f'(y) = \\frac{1}{1/x} = x\\)\nSince we solved \\(x = e^y\\), we can plug in to get: \\(f'(y) = e^y\\).\n\n\n\nPartial Derivatives\nSuppose that we have a function \\(f : X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\). Or in other words, a function with more than one variable input.\n\nHowever, we might only be interested in the rate of change (slope) relative to only one of the variables.\nA partial derivative is what we will need to find - the rate of change only in relation to one variable.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Definition: Partial Derivative\n\n\n\nA partial derivative is defined as:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} f(x_1, ..., x_i, ..., x_n) = \\lim\\limits_{h \\rightarrow 0 } \\frac{f(x_1, ..., x_i + h, ..., x_n) - f(x_1, ..., x_i, ..., x_n)}{h}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(x_1, ..., x_i, ...., x_n\\) are all the inputs of function \\(f\\).\nWhere we are only interested in the rate of change in respect to \\(x_i\\) (hence why only \\(x_i\\) has a \\(+h\\) in the numerator).\nAs a result, we treat \\(x_1, ..., x_n\\) that are not \\(x_i\\) as simply constants.\n\n\n\n \nTo solve a partial derivative, we take the derivative in respect to our specific variable \\(x_i\\), while treating all other input variables \\(x_1, ..., x_n\\) like a constant.\n\nSo essentially, we treat other variables like we would the number 5 - i.e. the derivative of a constant is 0, so the derivative of other variables is also 0.\n\n \nExample: Find the partial derivative in respect to \\(x\\) for \\(f(x, z) = 5x^2z^3 + 2x + 3z + 5\\)\n\nUse sum rule to split up derivative: \\(\\frac{\\partial f(x,z)}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}[5x^2z^3] + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}[2x] + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}[3z] + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}[5]\\).\nTake out constants from first term (remember \\(z\\) is constant here) \\(\\frac{\\partial f(x,z)}{\\partial x}  = 5z^3 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} [x^2] + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}[2x] + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}[3z] + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}[5]\\).\nFind derivatives, remember \\(z\\) is constant here: \\(\\frac{\\partial f(x,z)}{\\partial x} = 10z^3x + 2 + 0 + 0\\).\nThus, \\(\\frac{\\partial f(x,z)}{\\partial x} = 10z^3x + 2\\).\n\n\n\n\nApplication: Multiple Regression\nPartial derivatives are very useful in economic modelling and econometrics/statistics. We will introduce an application of partial derivatives with linear regression model.\nThe multiple linear regression model takes the following form (do not worry too much about this, this will be covered in the Econometrics sequence):\n\\[\n\\hat{Y} = \\hat{\\alpha} + \\hat{\\beta}_1X_1 + \\hat{\\beta}_2X_2 + ... + \\hat{\\beta}_k X_k\n\\]\nYou probably have heard that multiple linear regression is powerful because it allows us to see the independent effects of explanatory variables on output variables (if you have not, do not worry).\nLet us say we are interested in only the effect of \\(X_1\\) on \\(Y\\). We can take the partial derivative in respect to \\(X_1\\) as follows: \\[\n\\begin{split}\n& \\frac{\\partial \\hat{Y}}{\\partial X_1} = \\frac{\\partial \\hat{Y}}{\\partial X_1}[\\hat{\\alpha}] + \\frac{\\partial \\hat{Y}}{\\partial X_1}[\\hat{\\beta}_1X_1] + \\frac{\\partial \\hat{Y}}{\\partial X_1}[\\hat{\\beta}_2X_2] + ... + \\frac{\\partial \\hat{Y}}{\\partial X_1}[\\hat{\\beta}_kX_k] \\\\\n& \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial X_1} = 0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 + 0 + ... + 0 \\Longrightarrow \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial X_1} = \\hat{\\beta}_1\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nSo we can see, the effect of \\(X_1\\) on \\(\\hat{Y}\\) is \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\), and this is not affected by any other explanatory variables \\(X_2, ..., X_n\\). This shows how multiple linear regression allows us to “hold other variables constant” and isolate the effect of one variable.\n \nAlternatively, we can also use partial derivatives to find the effect of one variable in a moderating effect regression:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{Y} & = \\hat{\\alpha} + \\hat{\\beta}_1 X_1 + \\hat{\\beta}_2 X_2 + \\hat{\\beta}_3 X_1 X_2 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\hat{Y}}{\\partial X_1} & = 0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 + 0 + \\hat{\\beta}_3X_2 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\hat{Y}}{\\partial X_1} & = \\hat{\\beta}_1 + \\hat{\\beta}_3X_2\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nAs you can see, the relationship between \\(X_1\\) and \\(Y\\) here depends on the value of \\(X_2\\). In more intuitive words, given a one unit increase in \\(X_1\\), there is an expected \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1 + \\hat{\\beta_3}X_2\\) increase in \\(Y\\)."

More formally:\n\nA local maximum of function \\(f:I \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) is a point \\(a \\in I\\) with the property \\(f(a) ≥ f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) sufficiently near \\(x=a\\). A strict local maximum has the condition \\(f(a) &gt; f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) sufficiently near \\(x=a\\)\nA local minimum of function \\(f:I \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) is a point \\(a \\in I\\) with the property \\(f(a) ≤ f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) sufficiently near \\(x=a\\). A strict local minimum has the condition \\(f(a) &lt; f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) sufficiently near \\(x=a\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake an open interval set \\(I\\), and function \\(f : I \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\). A stationary point at \\(a \\in I\\) exists if \\(f'(a) = 0\\).\nMore intuitively, a stationary point is when the function is neither increasing or decreasing, and since the derivative function is a measure of the rate of change, a function neither increases or decreases when \\(f'(a) = 0\\). Visually:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcavity and Inflection Points\nA function \\(f:I \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) is called convex, if a line segment joining any two points on the graph of \\(f\\) lies above or on the graph of \\(f\\).\nA function \\(f: I \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) is called concave, if a line segment joining any two points on the graph of \\(f\\) lies below or on the graph of \\(f\\).\nA function \\(f: I \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) is strictly convex/concave, if a line segment joining any two points on the graph of \\(f\\) lies always above, or always below, the graph of \\(f\\).\nBelow are three figures of convex and concave functions. The first function is strictly convex:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Definition: Concavity with Second Derivatives\n\n\n\nIf function \\(f: I \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) is differentiable on an interval \\(I\\), we also have an alternative definition of concavity.\n\nIf for function \\(f\\) in interval \\(I\\), \\(f''(x) &gt; 0\\), then the function is convex.\nIf for function \\(f\\) in interval \\(I\\), \\(f''(x) &lt; 0\\), then the function is concave.\n\n\n\nIf a function \\(f\\) changes from convex to concave at point \\(a\\), or from concave or convex (or in other words, \\(f''(a) = 0\\) and it changes sign before and after \\(a\\)), that point is an inflection point. Inflection points do not always have to be differentiable, just the concavity has to change. Inflection points can also be stationary points, but not always, if \\(f'(x) = f''(x) = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Extrema\nTate the function \\(f: A \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\), in which \\(A\\) is domain of \\(f\\) such that \\(A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\).\nA global maximum of \\(f\\) is a point \\(a \\in A\\) such that \\(f(a) ≥ f(x)\\) for all \\(x \\in A\\). A strict global maximum is when the condition \\(f(a) &gt; f(x)\\) for all \\(x \\in A\\).\nA global minimum of \\(f\\) is a point \\(a \\in A\\) such that \\(f(a) ≤ f(x)\\) for all \\(x \\in A\\). A strict global minimum is when the condition \\(f(a) &lt; f(x)\\) for all \\(x \\in A\\).\nWhat is the difference between a local and global extrema?\nWell, a local exterma only has to be the maximum/minimum in its “neighbourhood”, meaning there can be multiple local extrema. There is only one global minimum and maximum in a function.\nGlobal extrema are a subset of local extrema. That means we can find global extrema by first finding local extrema, then eliminating some local extrema that are not global extrema. There can only be one global maximum or minimum in a function.\n\n\n\nOptimisation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Definition: Optimisation\n\n\n\nOptimisation is about finding the maximum or minimum point of a function. This is useful because we often want to minimise error, or maximise utility, or so on.\n\n\nIf a function is differentiable on an open interval, then a local extrema can only occur at a stationary point of this function. Since global extrema are a subset of local extrema, that means that global extrema must also occur at a stationary point of the function.\nFor a stationary point to be a local maximum, the function should be concave. For a stationary point to be a local minimum, the function should be convex. Why? - consider the following diagram:\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, we can identify local extrema of a function \\(f(x)\\) in an interval with these steps:\n\nFind \\(f'(x)\\), then find for what \\(x\\) makes \\(f'(x) = 0\\). These are the stationary points.\nFind \\(f''(x)\\). Plug in the \\(x\\) we solved for above. If \\(f''(x) &gt; 0\\), the function is convex, thus there is a local minimum. If \\(f''(x) &lt; 0\\), the function is concave, thus there is a local maximum.\nFind which extrema is most extreme - that is likely (but not guaranteed) to be the extrema in the interval.\n\nHowever, we are not done - we have to calculate the edge cases. These are the end-points of our interval. Why? - look at the following figure below - on the interval \\([-3, 7]\\), clearly \\(x=7\\) will have a larger maximum value than any local maximum, since the function tends towards infinity as \\(x\\) approaches infinity:\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, we have to check the edges of our intervals and see if they are the maximum or minimum in the interval, and compare them to the local extrema we found. Once we have found the \\(x\\) value that makes \\(f\\) output its maxmimum/minimum value within an interval, we have completed optimisation.\n\nExample\nFind the maximum value of \\(f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x\\) in the interval \\(x \\in [0, 3]\\).\n\nFind the first derivative: \\(f'(x) = 6x^2-18x+12\\).\nFind when \\(f'(x) = 0\\). Thus, \\(0 = 6x^2 - 18x + 12\\), factor so \\(\\Longrightarrow 0 = 6(x-2)(x-1)\\). Thus, the two \\(x\\) values that make \\('f(x) = 0\\) are \\(x=2, x=1\\).\nFind the 2nd derivative to distinguish maximums and minimums: \\(f''(x) = 12x - 18\\).\nPlug in our stationary points \\(x=2, x=1\\) we found earlier to find minimums and maximums: \\(f''(2) = 6\\), \\(f''(1) = -6\\). Since maximums are when \\(f''(x) &lt; 0\\), thus \\(x=1\\) is the only local maxmimum. We can plug in \\(x=1\\) into the original function to find the local maximum value of \\(f(1) = 5\\).\nTest our edge cases of our interval \\([0,3]\\). \\(f(0) = 0\\), \\(f(3) = 9\\). We can see that \\(f(3) = 9 &gt; f(1) = 5\\). Thus, \\(x=3\\) is the maximum point in this interval.\n\n\n\n\n\nConstrained Optimisation\nSometimes, we have constraints when doing optimisation. This is best demonstrated with an example.\nTake this scenario: a company wants to spend money on advertising. They can choose to spend \\(x\\) amount of money on TV advertising, and \\(y\\) amount of money on YouTube advertising. \\(f(x, y) = xy\\) is a function where the output is the increase in sales as a result of advertising. However, the company only has a total budget of $10 to spend on both, thus \\(x+y = 10\\).\nSimply, we want to maximise \\(f(x,y) = xy\\), given the constraint \\(x + y = 10\\).\n\nStart by solving for one variable within the constraint. Let us solve for \\(y\\), so \\(x + y = 10 \\Longrightarrow y = 10 - x\\).\nNow, substitute the constraint into the function we want to maximise: \\(f(xy) = xy \\Longrightarrow f(x) = x(10-x) \\Longrightarrow f(x) = -x^2 + 10x\\).\nFind the first derivative of our constraint function: \\(f'(x) = -2x + 10\\).\nThen, find when \\(f'(x) = 0\\) for stationary points: \\(0 = -2x+10 \\Longrightarrow x = 5\\).\nNow, find second derivative to see if our stationary point \\(x=5\\) is a maximum. \\(f''(x) = -2\\), thus \\(f''(5) = -2\\), thus \\(f''(5) &lt; 0\\) so it is a maximum.\nNow that we know \\(x=5\\) is a local maximum, plug into constraint to find value of \\(y\\): \\(y = 10 - x \\Longrightarrow y = 5\\).\nThus, \\(x=5, y=5\\) is the maximum of function \\(f(x,y) = xy\\). Plugging in \\(x=5, y=5\\), then the maximum output value if \\(f(5,5) = 25\\).\n\nThus, the general workflow of constrained optimisation is:\n\nSolve for one variable in the constraint.\nPlug into our function we want to optimise, and complete the optimisation process as normal.\nOnce we find the maximum value of one variable, plug into the constraint to find the other."

Let function \\(f : X \\rightarrow Y\\) be a function.\nAn indefinite integral of \\(f: X \\rightarrow Y\\) is a function \\(F\\) of form:\n\\[\nF(x) = \\int f(x) dx\n\\]\nSuch that its derivative is function \\(f\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\int f(x)dx \\right) = f(x)\n\\]\nSo essentially, integrals reverse derivatives, and derivatives reverse integrals.\n\n\nNote: there are many indefinite integrals \\(F\\), for any given function \\(f\\). This is because when we take a derivative, we lose any constants, since \\(\\frac{d}{dx} [c] = 0\\).\n\nMany different functions \\(F\\) with different \\(c\\), when taking the derivative, will result in function \\(f\\).\nThis is why you will see a \\(+C\\) at the end of integrals - which indicates that any constant \\(C\\) in integral \\(F\\) will result in the same derivative \\(f\\).\n\n\nIntegration Rules\nSince integrals are the opposite of derivatives, we can reverse many derivative rules to find rules of integration:\nConstant Rule: \\(\\int \\alpha f(x)dx = \\alpha \\int f(x)\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is a constant.\nSum Rule: \\(\\int [f(x) + g(x)]dx = \\int f(x)dx + \\int g(x)dx\\).\nReverse power rule: \\(\\int x^\\alpha dx = \\frac{x^{\\alpha + 1}}{\\alpha + 1} + C\\), when constant \\(\\alpha ≠ -1\\).\nNested power rule: \\(\\int [f(x)]^\\alpha f'(x)dx = \\frac{1}{\\alpha + 1} [f(x)]^{n+1} + C\\).\nPositive natural log integral: \\(\\int x^{-1} dx = \\ln(x) + C\\), when \\(x &gt; 0\\).\nNegative natural log integral: \\(\\int x^{-1}dx = \\ln (-x) + C\\), when \\(x &lt; 0\\).\nReverse nested log integral: \\(\\int \\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} = \\ln (f(x)) + C\\).\nExponential integral: \\(\\int e^x dx = e^x + C\\).\nNested exponential integral: \\(\\int e^{f(x)} f'(x)dx = e^{f(x)} + C\\).\nCosine integral: \\(\\int \\cos(x)dx = \\sin(x) + C\\).\nSine integral: \\(\\int \\sin(x)dx = - \\cos(x) + C\\).\nArctan integral: \\(\\int \\frac{1}{x^2 + 1}dx = \\arctan(x) + C\\).\nArcsine integral: \\(\\int \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}dx = \\arcsin(x) + C\\), when \\(x \\in (-1, 1)\\).\n\n\nExample 1:\nFind \\(\\int f(x)\\) where \\(f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1\\):\n\nUsing sum rule, we know: \\(\\int f(x) = \\int3x^2dx + \\int 2xdx + \\int 1dx\\).\nUsing constant rule, we know: \\(\\int f(x) = 3 \\int x^2dx + 2 \\int xdx + \\int1dx\\).\nUsing reverse power rule, we know: \\(\\int f(x) = 3 \\left( \\frac{1}{2+1} x^{2+1}\\right) + 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{1+1} x^{1+1} \\right) + x + C\\).\nSimplifying: \\(\\int f(x) = 3 \\left( \\frac{1}{3} x^3 \\right) + 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} x^2 \\right) + x + C\\).\nMultiply out: \\(\\int f(x) = x2 + x2 + x + C\\).\n\n\n\nExample 2:\nFind \\(\\int(fx)\\) where \\(f(x) = e^xe^{e^x}\\):\n\nWe know that \\(\\frac{d}{dx}[e^x] = e^x\\).\nUsing nested exponential integral rule: \\(\\int e^{f(x)} f'(x)dx = e^{f(x)} + C\\), we can define \\(f(x) = e^x\\) and \\(f'(x) = e^x\\).\nPutting it into this form, we get \\(\\int f(x) = e^{e^x} + C\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinite Integrals and Riemann Sums\nIntegrals are not only the opposite of derivatives, but are also a function for the area under a curve.\nFor example, say we have some function \\(f(x)\\). The area between \\(f(x)\\) and \\(y=0\\) can be calculated with the integral \\(F(x) = \\int f(x)dx\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Definition: Definite Integral\n\n\n\nA definite integral is the function \\(F\\) which measures the area under the curve of function \\(f\\) between \\(x=a\\) and \\(x=b\\). We notate the area under the curve of \\(f\\) between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as:\n\\[\n\\int\\limits_a^b f(x)dx\n\\]\n\n\nNow knowing that an definite integral is the area under a curve between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), how do we actually evaluate this function and calculate this area?\nWith a straight linear \\(f(x)\\), this is quite easy. However, when \\(f(x)\\) is non-linear and curved, it might seem quite hard to find the area under the curve.\nHowever, there is a strategy we can use - we can approximate the area under the curve using rectangles. The figure below shows this:\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how with more and more rectangles (with each rectangle having a smaller width), the more and more accurate our approximation of the area under a curve becomes.\nHow do we calculate the area of a rectangle? Of course: width \\(\\times\\) height.\n\nLet us call the width of each rectange \\(\\Delta x\\) (change in \\(x\\)).\nWhat is the height of each rectangle? Well, it is the value of \\(y = f(x)\\), the output of the function.\nThus, the area of each rectangle is \\(f(x) \\times \\Delta x\\).\n\nThus, to approximate the area under the curve, we can sum up all the rectangles as follows:\n\\[\n\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \\Delta x\n\\]\nHowever, as we noted, the smaller the width of each rectangle is, the more accurate our estimation of the area. How do we make the width of each rectangle infinitely smaller?\nWe can use a limit! With \\(\\lim\\limits_{\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0}\\), we can infinitely reduce the width of each rectangle, until we have a perfect measurement of the area under the curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Definition: Riemann Integral\n\n\n\nThe Riemann integral is a way to calculate the definite integral - the area under the function \\(f\\) between points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Mathematically:\n\\[\n\\int\\limits_a^b f(x)dx = \\lim\\limits_{\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \\Delta x\n\\]\nA Riemann Integral can, in theory, calculate any definite integral.\n\n\nA Riemann integral can calculate any integral. However, just like the formal definition of derivatives, sometimes, this can be very difficult to compute.\n\nLuckily for us, there is an alternative way to calculate definite integrals, that we will discuss in the next section.\n\n\n\nFundamental Theorem of Calculus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Definition: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\n\n\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus links definite and indefinite integrals. The theorem states:\n\\[\n\\int\\limits_a^bf(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)\n\\]\nWhere \\(F\\) is the indefinite integral of function \\(f\\).\n\n\nMore intuitively, it says that if we evaluate the indefinite integral \\(F\\), we can then plug in \\(F(b)\\) and \\(F(a)\\) and find the difference, in order to evaluate the definite integral. This allows us to not use Riemann Sums.\n\nExample:\nFind the area under the curve between \\(x =1\\) and \\(x=5\\) for function \\(f(x) = 3x^2\\).\n\nLet us find indefinite integral. Using reverse power rule: \\(\\int f(x)dx = F(x) = x^3+C\\).\nNow, fundamental theorem of calculus says \\(\\int\\limits_a^b f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)\\).\nLet us plug in \\(b\\) and \\(a\\). \\(F(b) = F(5) = 5^3 = 125\\), and \\(F(a) = F(1) = 1^3 = 1\\).\nFind the difference: \\(F(b) - F(a) = F(5) - F(1) = 125 - 1 = 124\\).\nThus, \\(\\int\\limits_1^5 3x^2dx = 124\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegration by Substitution\nIntegration by substitution is a technique that allows us to solve more complex integrals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Definition: Integration by Substitution\n\n\n\nIntegration by substitution, derived from the chain rule, is a rule that states:\n\\[\n\\int f[u(x)] u'(x)dx = F[u(x)] + c\n\\]\nOr in other words, if we can rearrange a function into the form \\(f[u(x)]u'(x)\\), we know its derivative will be in the form \\(F[u(x)]+c\\).\n\n\nSo, to solve an integral, we need to:\n\nLook at our original function in the integral, and see what \\(f(x)\\) and \\(u(x)\\) could make our original function take the form \\(f[u(x)]u'(x)\\). We need to make sure our function in this form is equal to the original function (so we are solving the same problem). This can involve some tinkering, including dividing our new form by a constant (see example 2).\nOnce we have our integral in that form, we know the integral will be equal to \\(F[u(x)]+c\\). So we must find \\(F(x) = \\int f(x)\\), and we will have our integral (since \\(u(x)\\) is already defined in the first step.\n\nIf we can re-represent our integral in the form \\(f(x)\\)’s and \\(u(x)\\)’s in the form of integration by substitution, and ensure that the \\(f(x)\\) we chose in that process is able to be integrated, we can find the integral.\nExample 1: find \\(\\int (x+4)^5 dx\\).\n\nLet us think how we can rewrite this in the form \\(f[u(x)]u'(x)\\). We could define \\(f(x) = u^5\\) and \\(u(x) = x+4\\) so that \\(f[u(x)]\\) section looks like \\((x+4)^5\\).\nHowever, we cannot forget about the extra \\(u'(x)\\) at the end of the form \\(f[u(x)]u'(x)\\). What is \\(u'(x)\\). Using simple derivation on \\(u(x) = x+4\\), we know \\(u'(x) = 1\\). Thus, in the form \\(f[u(x)]u'(x)\\), we have \\((x+4)^5 \\times 1\\), which is equivalent to our original equation.\nUsing integration by substitution, we know \\(\\int f[u(x)] u'(x)dx = F[u(x)] + c\\). So knowing \\(f(x)\\) and \\(u(x)\\), how do we get the integration answer in the form \\(F[u(x)] + c\\)?\nWe need to first find what \\(F(x) = \\int f(x)dx\\) is. The integral of \\(u^5\\), using reverse power rule, is \\(\\frac{1}{5+1} u^{5+1} + c= \\frac{1}{6} u^6 + c\\).\nNow that we know \\(F(x)\\), and \\(u(x)\\) from the very first step, we can put it in the form \\(F[u(x)] + c\\). Thus, our answer is \\(\\frac{1}{6}(x+4)^2 + c\\).\n\n \nExample 2: find \\(\\int e^{4x^2}x \\ dx\\).\n\nLet us think how we can rewrite this in the form \\(f[u(x)]u'(x)\\). We could define \\(f(x) = e^{u}\\) and \\(u(x) = 4x^2\\) so the \\(f[u(x)]\\) section looks like \\(e^{4x^2}\\).\nHowever, we cannot forget about the extra \\(u'(x)\\) at the end of the form \\(f[u(x)]u'(x)\\). What is \\(u'(x)\\)? Using power rule of \\(u(x) = 4x^2, \\ u'(x) = 8x\\). Thus, in the form \\(f[u(x)]u'(x)\\), we know have \\(e^{4x^2}8x\\).\nBut notice, our new form \\(e^{4x^2}8x\\) still does not equal our original equation \\(f(x) = e^{4x^2}x\\). We can adjust this by multiplying our new form by \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\), getting \\(\\frac{1}{8} e^{4x^2}8x\\).\nUsing integration by substitution, we know \\(\\int f[u(x)] u'(x)dx = F[u(x)] + c\\), thus \\(\\frac{1}{8} \\int e^{4x^2} 8xdx = F[u(x)]\\). But what is \\(F = \\int f(x)\\)? since \\(f(x)=e^{u}\\), using integration rules, \\(F(x) = e^u + c\\).\nSince the integral by substitution is \\(F[u(x)]\\), we input our \\(u(x) = 4x^2\\) into this to get \\(F[u(x)] = e^{4x^2} + C\\)\nLet us not forget the \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) outside of our interval! Thus, our integral is \\(\\frac{1}{8} e^{4x^2} + c\\).\n\n\n\n\nIntegration by Parts\nIntegration by parts is another technique for solving more difficult integrals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Definition: Integration by Parts\n\n\n\nIntegration by parts, derived from the product rule, is defined as:\n\\[\n\\int f(x) g'(x) dx = f(x)g(x) - \\int f'(x) g(x)dx\n\\]\nSo, if we can find some way to represent our initial integral equation in the form \\(f(x) g'(x)\\), and \\(f'(x)g(x)\\) is able to be integrated, we can find the integral.\n\n\nSo, to solve an integral, we need to:\n\nLook at our original function in the integral, and see what \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g'(x)\\) could make our original function take the form \\(f(x)g'(x)\\). We need to make sure our function in this form is equal to the original function (so we are solving the same problem).\nThen we can solve for \\(\\int f'(x)g(x)dx\\) and \\(\\int g'(x)dx = g(x)\\).\nWIth that, we can find the final integral which is in the form \\(f(x)g(x) - \\int f'(x) g(x)dx\\).\n\nSo, if we can find some way to represent our initial integral equation in the form \\(f(x) g'(x)\\), and \\(f'(x)g(x)\\) is able to be integrated, we can find the integral.\n \nExample 1: Find \\(\\int xe^xdx\\).\n\nLet us define \\(f(x) = x\\) and \\(g'(x) = e^x\\). This means the form \\(f(x) g'(x)\\) will equal our original equation.\nThus, we know \\(f'(x) = 1\\) and \\(\\int g'(x)dx = \\int e^xdx = e^x\\).\nThat means \\(\\int f'(x)g(x)dx = \\int 1e^xdx = \\int e^x = e^x+c\\).\nNow with all the parts, we can put into the final form \\(f(x)g(x) - \\int f'(x) g(x)d\\). Thus, our answer is \\(xe^x -e^x + c\\).\n\n \nExample 2: find \\(\\int \\ln(x)dx\\).\n\nLet us define \\(f(x) = \\ln (x)\\) and \\(g'(x) = 1\\). That means the form \\(f(x) g'(x)\\) will equal our original equation.\nThus, we know \\(f'(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\) and \\(g(x) = \\int g'(x) = \\int 1dx = x\\).\nThat means \\(\\int f'(x)g(x)dx = \\int \\frac{1}{x}xdx = \\int 1dx = x + c\\).\nNow with all the parts, we can put into the final form \\(f(x)g(x) - \\int f'(x) g(x)d\\). Thus, our answer is \\(\\ln(x) - x + c\\)."

    "text": "Basic Probability\nSee Mathematical Methods for Political Economy for more detailed explanations.\n\nSets and Set Operators\nA set is the collection of objects, while the elements of the set are the specific objects within a set. A capital letter is used to represent a set, for example, set \\(A\\). A lowercase letter represents an element within the set. For example, element \\(a\\) is a part of set \\(A\\).\nThere are a few different set operators that are important to understand.\nAn intersection of sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), formally notated \\(A \\cap B\\), indicates the elements that are both within \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) at the same time.\n\nFor example, if \\(A = \\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(B = \\{2,3,4\\}\\), then \\(A \\cap B = \\{2, 3\\}\\), since those are the elements that are contained in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) at the same time.\n\nA union of sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), formally notated as \\(A \\cup B\\), indicates elements that are in either \\(A\\), \\(B\\), or both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\nFor example, if \\(A = \\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(B = \\{2,3,4\\}\\), then \\(A \\cap B = \\{1,2, 3,4\\}\\).\n\\(A \\cup B = A + B -A \\cap B\\). We subtract \\(A \\cap B\\) since that part is counted twice in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), so we need to get rid of it once to avoid over-counting.\n\nThe complement of set \\(A\\) is everything that is not in \\(A\\), but still within the universal set. The complement is denoted as \\(A'\\) or \\(A^c\\).\n\nFor example, if the universal set contains \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\), and \\(A = \\{1,2\\}\\), then \\(A' = \\{3,4,5\\}\\)\n\nA subset \\(A\\) has all its elements belonging to another set \\(B\\). This is notated \\(A \\subset B\\).\n\nFor example, if \\(A = \\{1,2\\}\\), and \\(B = \\{1,2,3\\}\\), then \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\) since all of \\(A\\)’s elements belong to set \\(B\\) as well.\n\n\n\nBasic Properties of Probability\nKolmogrov’s Axioms are the key properties of probability:\n\nFor any event \\(A\\), the probability of \\(A\\) occurring is between 0 and 1.\nThe probability of all events in the sample space \\(S\\) is 1. Mathematically: \\(Pr(S) = 1\\). The sample space is the set of all possible events.\nIf we have a group of mutually exclusive events \\(A_1, A_2, ... , A_k\\), then the probability of those events all occurring is the sum of their probabilities. Mathematically, \\(Pr \\left( \\bigcup A_i \\right) = \\sum Pr(A_i)\\)\n\nNote: mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur at the same time together.\n\n\nOther important properties to note include:\n\n\\(Pr(A') = 1 - Pr(A)\\) - the probability of the complement of \\(A\\), is equal to 1 minus the probability of \\(A\\)\n\\(Pr(A \\cup B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B) - Pr(A \\cap B)\\) - this is because of a property of unions, as shown in section 2.2\n\n\n\nJoint and Conditional Probability\nJoint Probability is the probability of two or more events occurring simultaneously. The joint probability of events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is notated \\(Pr(A \\cap B)\\).\nFor example, in a deck of cards, \\(A\\) could be the event of drawing an ace, and \\(B\\) could be the event of drawing a spade. Thus, \\(Pr(A \\cap B)\\) would be the probability of drawing a card that was both an ace and a spade.\nConditional Probability is the probability of one event occurring, given another has already occurred. Probability of event \\(A\\), given event \\(B\\) has occurred, is notated as \\(Pr(A|B)\\)\nTo calculate the conditional probability, we use the following formula:\n\\[\nPr(A|B) = \\frac{Pr(A \\cap B)}{Pr(B)}\n\\]\n\n\nBayes’ Theorem\nBayes’ Theorem states the following relationship is true:\n\\[\nPr(A|B) = \\frac{Pr(B|A) \\times Pr(A)}{Pr(B)}\n\\]\nEach part of Bayes’ Theorem has a name. They are commonly referenced, so it is useful to know their names:\n\n\\(Pr(A|B)\\) is the conditional probability\n\\(Pr(B|A)\\) is the posterior probability\n\\(Pr(A)\\) is the prior probability\n\\(Pr(B)\\) is the marginal probability"

    "text": "Basic Statistics\nSee Essential Mathematics for Political Economy for more detailed explanations.\n\nRandom Variables\nRandom variables are variables that represent unobserved events that have some randomness - a set of potential outcomes, with each outcome having a probability of occurring.\nFor example, if you flip a coin 10 times, and count the number of heads you get, you could get 5 heads, 6 heads, 4 heads, or any amount between 0 and 10. We are not sure what will happen - however, some outcomes are more likely than others, because of the probabilities associated with each outcome.\nThere are two types of random variables:\n\nDiscrete Random Variables are random events which have a distinct number of outcomes. For example, rolling a dice has 6 outcomes.\nContinuos Random Variables are random events which have an infinite amount of outcomes. For example, my drive to work tomorrow could take 5 minutes, 5.123 minutes, 5.234237847 minutes, and so on… there is no distinct outcomes since you can continuously subdivide the gaps between outcomes by adding more decimal points.\n\n\n\nDistributions and Probability Density Functions\nRandom variables are often called distributions - because there are a distribution of outcomes, with associated probabilities for each outcome. We can actually graph this - put potential outcomes on the \\(x\\) axis, and the probability that each outcome occurs on the \\(y\\) axis.\nFor example, take this probability distribution of a die - there are 6 sides that you could land on, and each has an equal probability of occurring:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe probability mass/density function \\(f(y)\\) takes a potential outcome of an event as an input, and outputs the respective probability.\nFor example, the probability mass/density function of a dice is \\(f(y) = 1/6\\). This is because every outcome \\(y\\) has the same probability of occurring: \\(1/6\\). So \\(f(1), f(2)... = 1/6\\).\n\n\nExpectation and Variance\nExpectation and Variance are two ways we can summarise the distributions of random variables.\nThe expectation, often called the expected value or mean, is the best guess of an outcome of a random variable, given no other information except its distribution. We notate expected value of a variable \\(Y\\) as either \\(E[Y]\\), \\(\\bar{Y}\\), or \\(\\mu\\).\nThe expected value for discrete variables is calculated by multiplying each outcome value by its associated probability, then doing that for all outcomes, and summing everything together. In other words, it is a weighted average of the outcomes, with the weights being the probability of each outcome.\n\\[\nE[Y] = y_1 \\times f(y_1) + y_2 \\times f(y_2)... = \\sum [y_j \\times f(y_j)]\n\\]\nFor a continuous random variable, it is a little more complicated. This is because continuous variables have an infinite number of potential outcomes. For example, if you drive to school, your driving time could be 23 minutes, or 23.12 minutes, or 23.123324 minutes… basically, an infinite amount. As a result, we have to alter the expected value formula a little:\n\\[\nE[Y] = \\int\\limits_{-∞}^∞ y \\times f(y)dy\n\\]\nVariance \\(\\sigma^2\\) is a measure of how spread out our distribution is. Variance basically measures how far values are, on average, from the mean of the variable. Mathematically:\n\\[\nVar(X) = \\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum (X-\\mu)^2 = E[(X - \\mu)^2]\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance, \\(n\\) is the number of observations, and \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of \\(X\\)\nStandard Deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is the square root of variance \\(\\sigma^2\\)\n\n\nNormal Distribution and T Distribution\nA normal distribution is in the shape of a bell curve. The mean \\(\\mu\\), mode, and median are all the same value at the centre, and the distribution is symmetrical on both sides. The figure below shows the typical shape of a normal distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Normal Distributions, as shown in the image above, follow the 68-95-99.7 rule:\n\nWithin one standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) of the mean \\(\\mu\\), lies 68.26% of the total area under the curve\nWithin 2 standard deviations \\(2 \\sigma\\) of the mean \\(\\mu\\), lies 95.44% of the total area under the curve\nIn fact, any amount of standard deviations \\(\\sigma\\), including decimals, is related to a specific percent of total area under the curve, for all normal distributions.\n\nThis is important, because the area under the distribution curve is the probability. Thus, the normal distribution tells us there is a relationship between the standard deviation and the probability of an action occurring.\nAny normal distribution can be described with 2 features: mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) in the following form: \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). For example, \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N} (30, 4)\\) means a normal distribution with mean 30 and variance 4.\nThe T distribution is a distribution very similar to the shape and size of the normal distribution, however, generally has thicker tails and a lower peak. The key difference is that t-distributions are defined with only one parameter - degrees of freedom \\(DF\\).\n\n\nCovariance and Correlation\nIn political economy, we are often interested in the relationship between two variables. For example, are oil producers more likely to be democratic? Are more educated voters more likely to turn out and vote? The relationship between two features, also called correlation, is the extent to which they tend to occur together.\n\nA positive correlation/relationship is when we are more likely to observe feature \\(Y\\), if feature \\(X\\) is present\nA negative correlation/relationship is when we are less likely to observe feature \\(Y\\), if feature \\(X\\) is present\nNo correlation/relationship is when we see feature \\(X\\), that does not tell us anything about the likelihood of observing \\(Y\\)\n\nWe can also visualise these graphically:\n\n\n\n\n\nCovariance is a way to measure the relationship between two variables. Covariance is the extent that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) vary together. Mathematically:\n\\[\nCov(X,Y) = \\sigma_{XY} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})\n\\]\nOr more simply:\n\nIn our data, we have many different pairs of data points \\((X_i, Y_i)\\)\n\\(X_i\\) is some value of \\(X\\), and \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the mean of \\(X\\). Same goes for \\(Y_i\\) and \\(\\bar{Y}\\)\nThus, \\(X_i - \\bar{X}\\) is the distance between any point \\(X_i\\) and the mean \\(\\bar{X}\\). Same goes for \\(Y_i - \\bar{Y}\\)\n\\(n\\) is the number of observations (data points) in our data\n\nWe can interpret the sign of the covariance: if it is positive, we have a positive relationship. if it is negative, we have a negative relationship. However, we cannot interpret the numerical value of the covariance.\nTo do that, we have to find the correlation coefficient. We calculate this by taking the covariance, and dividing it by the product of the standard deviation of \\(X\\) and the standard deviation of \\(Y\\). Mathematically:\n\\[\nCorr(X,Y) = r = \\frac{Cov(X,Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y}\n\\]\nThe correlation coefficient is always between -1 and 1.\n\nThe direction is the same as the covariance - if the coefficient is positive, then we have a positive relationship, vice versa.\nIf the correlation coefficient is closer to -1 or 1, it means a strong correlation. If the correlation is closer to 0, then it is a weak correlation\n\n\n\nBest Linear Predictor\nWhile the correlation coefficient tells us the strength of a correlation, it does not say anything about the magnitude of the relationship. For example, if \\(X\\) increases by one unit, how much does \\(Y\\) increase by? The correlation coefficient does not say.\n\nIn a linear model, the \\(X\\) variable is considered the explanatory or independent variable, while the \\(Y\\) is the response or dependent variable.\n\nMagnitude is quite an important concept. After all, even if two values are very highly correlated, if an increase of one unit in \\(X\\) only leads to a miniscule increase in \\(Y\\), this relationship might not be very important for understanding the world.\nA way to estimate the magnitude of the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is the best linear predictor. The best linear predictor is a best fit line for the data, that takes the form of a linear equation: \\(Y = \\alpha + \\beta X\\).\nIn this equation, the \\(\\beta\\) term in the best fit line is the slope of the linear equation. Essentially, it tells us for every increase in one unit of \\(X\\), how much do we expect \\(Y\\) to increase by?\n\nWe can interpret the sign of \\(\\beta\\): a positive \\(\\beta\\) is a positive relationship, a negative \\(\\beta\\) is a negative relationship, and \\(\\beta = 0\\) is no relationship.\nWe can also interpret the magnitude of \\(\\beta\\): as \\(X\\) increases by 1 unit, \\(Y\\) is expected to increase by \\(\\beta\\) units.\n\nThe Best Linear Predictor is a form of Linear Regression, the primary topic we will cover in the next two chapters."
