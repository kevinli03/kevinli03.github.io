    "text": "Basic Probability\nSee Mathematical Methods for Political Economy for more detailed explanations.\n\nSets and Set Operators\nA set is the collection of objects, while the elements of the set are the specific objects within a set. A capital letter is used to represent a set, for example, set \\(A\\). A lowercase letter represents an element within the set. For example, element \\(a\\) is a part of set \\(A\\).\nThere are a few different set operators that are important to understand.\nAn intersection of sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), formally notated \\(A \\cap B\\), indicates the elements that are both within \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) at the same time.\n\nFor example, if \\(A = \\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(B = \\{2,3,4\\}\\), then \\(A \\cap B = \\{2, 3\\}\\), since those are the elements that are contained in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) at the same time.\n\nA union of sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), formally notated as \\(A \\cup B\\), indicates elements that are in either \\(A\\), \\(B\\), or both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\nFor example, if \\(A = \\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(B = \\{2,3,4\\}\\), then \\(A \\cap B = \\{1,2, 3,4\\}\\).\n\\(A \\cup B = A + B -A \\cap B\\). We subtract \\(A \\cap B\\) since that part is counted twice in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), so we need to get rid of it once to avoid over-counting.\n\nThe complement of set \\(A\\) is everything that is not in \\(A\\), but still within the universal set. The complement is denoted as \\(A'\\) or \\(A^c\\).\n\nFor example, if the universal set contains \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\), and \\(A = \\{1,2\\}\\), then \\(A' = \\{3,4,5\\}\\)\n\nA subset \\(A\\) has all its elements belonging to another set \\(B\\). This is notated \\(A \\subset B\\).\n\nFor example, if \\(A = \\{1,2\\}\\), and \\(B = \\{1,2,3\\}\\), then \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\) since all of \\(A\\)’s elements belong to set \\(B\\) as well.\n\n\n\nBasic Properties of Probability\nKolmogrov’s Axioms are the key properties of probability:\n\nFor any event \\(A\\), the probability of \\(A\\) occurring is between 0 and 1.\nThe probability of all events in the sample space \\(S\\) is 1. Mathematically: \\(Pr(S) = 1\\). The sample space is the set of all possible events.\nIf we have a group of mutually exclusive events \\(A_1, A_2, ... , A_k\\), then the probability of those events all occurring is the sum of their probabilities. Mathematically, \\(Pr \\left( \\bigcup A_i \\right) = \\sum Pr(A_i)\\)\n\nNote: mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur at the same time together.\n\n\nOther important properties to note include:\n\n\\(Pr(A') = 1 - Pr(A)\\) - the probability of the complement of \\(A\\), is equal to 1 minus the probability of \\(A\\)\n\\(Pr(A \\cup B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B) - Pr(A \\cap B)\\) - this is because of a property of unions, as shown in section 2.2\n\n\n\nJoint and Conditional Probability\nJoint Probability is the probability of two or more events occurring simultaneously. The joint probability of events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is notated \\(Pr(A \\cap B)\\).\nFor example, in a deck of cards, \\(A\\) could be the event of drawing an ace, and \\(B\\) could be the event of drawing a spade. Thus, \\(Pr(A \\cap B)\\) would be the probability of drawing a card that was both an ace and a spade.\nConditional Probability is the probability of one event occurring, given another has already occurred. Probability of event \\(A\\), given event \\(B\\) has occurred, is notated as \\(Pr(A|B)\\)\nTo calculate the conditional probability, we use the following formula:\n\\[\nPr(A|B) = \\frac{Pr(A \\cap B)}{Pr(B)}\n\\]\n\n\nBayes’ Theorem\nBayes’ Theorem states the following relationship is true:\n\\[\nPr(A|B) = \\frac{Pr(B|A) \\times Pr(A)}{Pr(B)}\n\\]\nEach part of Bayes’ Theorem has a name. They are commonly referenced, so it is useful to know their names:\n\n\\(Pr(A|B)\\) is the conditional probability\n\\(Pr(B|A)\\) is the posterior probability\n\\(Pr(A)\\) is the prior probability\n\\(Pr(B)\\) is the marginal probability"

    "section": "Basic Statistics",
    "text": "Basic Statistics\nSee Essential Mathematics for Political Economy for more detailed explanations.\n\nRandom Variables\nRandom variables are variables that represent unobserved events that have some randomness - a set of potential outcomes, with each outcome having a probability of occurring.\nFor example, if you flip a coin 10 times, and count the number of heads you get, you could get 5 heads, 6 heads, 4 heads, or any amount between 0 and 10. We are not sure what will happen - however, some outcomes are more likely than others, because of the probabilities associated with each outcome.\nThere are two types of random variables:\n\nDiscrete Random Variables are random events which have a distinct number of outcomes. For example, rolling a dice has 6 outcomes.\nContinuos Random Variables are random events which have an infinite amount of outcomes. For example, my drive to work tomorrow could take 5 minutes, 5.123 minutes, 5.234237847 minutes, and so on… there is no distinct outcomes since you can continuously subdivide the gaps between outcomes by adding more decimal points.\n\n\n\nDistributions and Probability Density Functions\nRandom variables are often called distributions - because there are a distribution of outcomes, with associated probabilities for each outcome. We can actually graph this - put potential outcomes on the \\(x\\) axis, and the probability that each outcome occurs on the \\(y\\) axis.\nFor example, take this probability distribution of a die - there are 6 sides that you could land on, and each has an equal probability of occurring:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe probability mass/density function \\(f(y)\\) takes a potential outcome of an event as an input, and outputs the respective probability.\nFor example, the probability mass/density function of a dice is \\(f(y) = 1/6\\). This is because every outcome \\(y\\) has the same probability of occurring: \\(1/6\\). So \\(f(1), f(2)... = 1/6\\).\n\n\nExpectation and Variance\nExpectation and Variance are two ways we can summarise the distributions of random variables.\nThe expectation, often called the expected value or mean, is the best guess of an outcome of a random variable, given no other information except its distribution. We notate expected value of a variable \\(Y\\) as either \\(E[Y]\\), \\(\\bar{Y}\\), or \\(\\mu\\).\nThe expected value for discrete variables is calculated by multiplying each outcome value by its associated probability, then doing that for all outcomes, and summing everything together. In other words, it is a weighted average of the outcomes, with the weights being the probability of each outcome.\n\\[\nE[Y] = y_1 \\times f(y_1) + y_2 \\times f(y_2)... = \\sum [y_j \\times f(y_j)]\n\\]\nFor a continuous random variable, it is a little more complicated. This is because continuous variables have an infinite number of potential outcomes. For example, if you drive to school, your driving time could be 23 minutes, or 23.12 minutes, or 23.123324 minutes… basically, an infinite amount. As a result, we have to alter the expected value formula a little:\n\\[\nE[Y] = \\int\\limits_{-∞}^∞ y \\times f(y)dy\n\\]\nVariance \\(\\sigma^2\\) is a measure of how spread out our distribution is. Variance basically measures how far values are, on average, from the mean of the variable. Mathematically:\n\\[\nVar(X) = \\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum (X-\\mu)^2 = E[(X - \\mu)^2]\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance, \\(n\\) is the number of observations, and \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of \\(X\\)\nStandard Deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is the square root of variance \\(\\sigma^2\\)\n\n\nNormal Distribution and T Distribution\nA normal distribution is in the shape of a bell curve. The mean \\(\\mu\\), mode, and median are all the same value at the centre, and the distribution is symmetrical on both sides. The figure below shows the typical shape of a normal distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Normal Distributions, as shown in the image above, follow the 68-95-99.7 rule:\n\nWithin one standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) of the mean \\(\\mu\\), lies 68.26% of the total area under the curve\nWithin 2 standard deviations \\(2 \\sigma\\) of the mean \\(\\mu\\), lies 95.44% of the total area under the curve\nIn fact, any amount of standard deviations \\(\\sigma\\), including decimals, is related to a specific percent of total area under the curve, for all normal distributions.\n\nThis is important, because the area under the distribution curve is the probability. Thus, the normal distribution tells us there is a relationship between the standard deviation and the probability of an action occurring.\nAny normal distribution can be described with 2 features: mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) in the following form: \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). For example, \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N} (30, 4)\\) means a normal distribution with mean 30 and variance 4.\nThe T distribution is a distribution very similar to the shape and size of the normal distribution, however, generally has thicker tails and a lower peak. The key difference is that t-distributions are defined with only one parameter - degrees of freedom \\(DF\\).\n\n\nCovariance and Correlation\nIn political economy, we are often interested in the relationship between two variables. For example, are oil producers more likely to be democratic? Are more educated voters more likely to turn out and vote? The relationship between two features, also called correlation, is the extent to which they tend to occur together.\n\nA positive correlation/relationship is when we are more likely to observe feature \\(Y\\), if feature \\(X\\) is present\nA negative correlation/relationship is when we are less likely to observe feature \\(Y\\), if feature \\(X\\) is present\nNo correlation/relationship is when we see feature \\(X\\), that does not tell us anything about the likelihood of observing \\(Y\\)\n\nWe can also visualise these graphically:\n\n\n\n\n\nCovariance is a way to measure the relationship between two variables. Covariance is the extent that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) vary together. Mathematically:\n\\[\nCov(X,Y) = \\sigma_{XY} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})\n\\]\nOr more simply:\n\nIn our data, we have many different pairs of data points \\((X_i, Y_i)\\)\n\\(X_i\\) is some value of \\(X\\), and \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the mean of \\(X\\). Same goes for \\(Y_i\\) and \\(\\bar{Y}\\)\nThus, \\(X_i - \\bar{X}\\) is the distance between any point \\(X_i\\) and the mean \\(\\bar{X}\\). Same goes for \\(Y_i - \\bar{Y}\\)\n\\(n\\) is the number of observations (data points) in our data\n\nWe can interpret the sign of the covariance: if it is positive, we have a positive relationship. if it is negative, we have a negative relationship. However, we cannot interpret the numerical value of the covariance.\nTo do that, we have to find the correlation coefficient. We calculate this by taking the covariance, and dividing it by the product of the standard deviation of \\(X\\) and the standard deviation of \\(Y\\). Mathematically:\n\\[\nCorr(X,Y) = r = \\frac{Cov(X,Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y}\n\\]\nThe correlation coefficient is always between -1 and 1.\n\nThe direction is the same as the covariance - if the coefficient is positive, then we have a positive relationship, vice versa.\nIf the correlation coefficient is closer to -1 or 1, it means a strong correlation. If the correlation is closer to 0, then it is a weak correlation\n\n\n\nBest Linear Predictor\nWhile the correlation coefficient tells us the strength of a correlation, it does not say anything about the magnitude of the relationship. For example, if \\(X\\) increases by one unit, how much does \\(Y\\) increase by? The correlation coefficient does not say.\n\nIn a linear model, the \\(X\\) variable is considered the explanatory or independent variable, while the \\(Y\\) is the response or dependent variable.\n\nMagnitude is quite an important concept. After all, even if two values are very highly correlated, if an increase of one unit in \\(X\\) only leads to a miniscule increase in \\(Y\\), this relationship might not be very important for understanding the world.\nA way to estimate the magnitude of the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is the best linear predictor. The best linear predictor is a best fit line for the data, that takes the form of a linear equation: \\(Y = \\alpha + \\beta X\\).\nIn this equation, the \\(\\beta\\) term in the best fit line is the slope of the linear equation. Essentially, it tells us for every increase in one unit of \\(X\\), how much do we expect \\(Y\\) to increase by?\n\nWe can interpret the sign of \\(\\beta\\): a positive \\(\\beta\\) is a positive relationship, a negative \\(\\beta\\) is a negative relationship, and \\(\\beta = 0\\) is no relationship.\nWe can also interpret the magnitude of \\(\\beta\\): as \\(X\\) increases by 1 unit, \\(Y\\) is expected to increase by \\(\\beta\\) units.\n\nThe Best Linear Predictor is a form of Linear Regression, the primary topic we will cover in the next two chapters."
