    "text": "Basic Probability\nSee Mathematical Methods for Political Economy for more detailed explanations.\n\nSets and Set Operators\nA set is the collection of objects, while the elements of the set are the specific objects within a set. A capital letter is used to represent a set, for example, set \\(A\\). A lowercase letter represents an element within the set. For example, element \\(a\\) is a part of set \\(A\\).\nThere are a few different set operators that are important to understand.\nAn intersection of sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), formally notated \\(A \\cap B\\), indicates the elements that are both within \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) at the same time.\n\nFor example, if \\(A = \\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(B = \\{2,3,4\\}\\), then \\(A \\cap B = \\{2, 3\\}\\), since those are the elements that are contained in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) at the same time.\n\nA union of sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), formally notated as \\(A \\cup B\\), indicates elements that are in either \\(A\\), \\(B\\), or both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\nFor example, if \\(A = \\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(B = \\{2,3,4\\}\\), then \\(A \\cap B = \\{1,2, 3,4\\}\\).\n\\(A \\cup B = A + B -A \\cap B\\). We subtract \\(A \\cap B\\) since that part is counted twice in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), so we need to get rid of it once to avoid over-counting.\n\nThe complement of set \\(A\\) is everything that is not in \\(A\\), but still within the universal set. The complement is denoted as \\(A'\\) or \\(A^c\\).\n\nFor example, if the universal set contains \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\), and \\(A = \\{1,2\\}\\), then \\(A' = \\{3,4,5\\}\\)\n\nA subset \\(A\\) has all its elements belonging to another set \\(B\\). This is notated \\(A \\subset B\\).\n\nFor example, if \\(A = \\{1,2\\}\\), and \\(B = \\{1,2,3\\}\\), then \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\) since all of \\(A\\)’s elements belong to set \\(B\\) as well.\n\n\n\nBasic Properties of Probability\nKolmogrov’s Axioms are the key properties of probability:\n\nFor any event \\(A\\), the probability of \\(A\\) occurring is between 0 and 1.\nThe probability of all events in the sample space \\(S\\) is 1. Mathematically: \\(Pr(S) = 1\\). The sample space is the set of all possible events.\nIf we have a group of mutually exclusive events \\(A_1, A_2, ... , A_k\\), then the probability of those events all occurring is the sum of their probabilities. Mathematically, \\(Pr \\left( \\bigcup A_i \\right) = \\sum Pr(A_i)\\)\n\nNote: mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur at the same time together.\n\n\nOther important properties to note include:\n\n\\(Pr(A') = 1 - Pr(A)\\) - the probability of the complement of \\(A\\), is equal to 1 minus the probability of \\(A\\)\n\\(Pr(A \\cup B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B) - Pr(A \\cap B)\\) - this is because of a property of unions, as shown in section 2.2\n\n\n\nJoint and Conditional Probability\nJoint Probability is the probability of two or more events occurring simultaneously. The joint probability of events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is notated \\(Pr(A \\cap B)\\).\nFor example, in a deck of cards, \\(A\\) could be the event of drawing an ace, and \\(B\\) could be the event of drawing a spade. Thus, \\(Pr(A \\cap B)\\) would be the probability of drawing a card that was both an ace and a spade.\nConditional Probability is the probability of one event occurring, given another has already occurred. Probability of event \\(A\\), given event \\(B\\) has occurred, is notated as \\(Pr(A|B)\\)\nTo calculate the conditional probability, we use the following formula:\n\\[\nPr(A|B) = \\frac{Pr(A \\cap B)}{Pr(B)}\n\\]\n\n\nBayes’ Theorem\nBayes’ Theorem states the following relationship is true:\n\\[\nPr(A|B) = \\frac{Pr(B|A) \\times Pr(A)}{Pr(B)}\n\\]\nEach part of Bayes’ Theorem has a name. They are commonly referenced, so it is useful to know their names:\n\n\\(Pr(A|B)\\) is the conditional probability\n\\(Pr(B|A)\\) is the posterior probability\n\\(Pr(A)\\) is the prior probability\n\\(Pr(B)\\) is the marginal probability"

    "text": "Basic Statistics\nSee Essential Mathematics for Political Economy for more detailed explanations.\n\nRandom Variables\nRandom variables are variables that represent unobserved events that have some randomness - a set of potential outcomes, with each outcome having a probability of occurring.\nFor example, if you flip a coin 10 times, and count the number of heads you get, you could get 5 heads, 6 heads, 4 heads, or any amount between 0 and 10. We are not sure what will happen - however, some outcomes are more likely than others, because of the probabilities associated with each outcome.\nThere are two types of random variables:\n\nDiscrete Random Variables are random events which have a distinct number of outcomes. For example, rolling a dice has 6 outcomes.\nContinuos Random Variables are random events which have an infinite amount of outcomes. For example, my drive to work tomorrow could take 5 minutes, 5.123 minutes, 5.234237847 minutes, and so on… there is no distinct outcomes since you can continuously subdivide the gaps between outcomes by adding more decimal points.\n\n\n\nDistributions and Probability Density Functions\nRandom variables are often called distributions - because there are a distribution of outcomes, with associated probabilities for each outcome. We can actually graph this - put potential outcomes on the \\(x\\) axis, and the probability that each outcome occurs on the \\(y\\) axis.\nFor example, take this probability distribution of a die - there are 6 sides that you could land on, and each has an equal probability of occurring:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe probability mass/density function \\(f(y)\\) takes a potential outcome of an event as an input, and outputs the respective probability.\nFor example, the probability mass/density function of a dice is \\(f(y) = 1/6\\). This is because every outcome \\(y\\) has the same probability of occurring: \\(1/6\\). So \\(f(1), f(2)... = 1/6\\).\n\n\nExpectation and Variance\nExpectation and Variance are two ways we can summarise the distributions of random variables.\nThe expectation, often called the expected value or mean, is the best guess of an outcome of a random variable, given no other information except its distribution. We notate expected value of a variable \\(Y\\) as either \\(E[Y]\\), \\(\\bar{Y}\\), or \\(\\mu\\).\nThe expected value for discrete variables is calculated by multiplying each outcome value by its associated probability, then doing that for all outcomes, and summing everything together. In other words, it is a weighted average of the outcomes, with the weights being the probability of each outcome.\n\\[\nE[Y] = y_1 \\times f(y_1) + y_2 \\times f(y_2)... = \\sum [y_j \\times f(y_j)]\n\\]\nFor a continuous random variable, it is a little more complicated. This is because continuous variables have an infinite number of potential outcomes. For example, if you drive to school, your driving time could be 23 minutes, or 23.12 minutes, or 23.123324 minutes… basically, an infinite amount. As a result, we have to alter the expected value formula a little:\n\\[\nE[Y] = \\int\\limits_{-∞}^∞ y \\times f(y)dy\n\\]\nVariance \\(\\sigma^2\\) is a measure of how spread out our distribution is. Variance basically measures how far values are, on average, from the mean of the variable. Mathematically:\n\\[\nVar(X) = \\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum (X-\\mu)^2 = E[(X - \\mu)^2]\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance, \\(n\\) is the number of observations, and \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of \\(X\\)\nStandard Deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is the square root of variance \\(\\sigma^2\\)\n\n\nNormal Distribution and T Distribution\nA normal distribution is in the shape of a bell curve. The mean \\(\\mu\\), mode, and median are all the same value at the centre, and the distribution is symmetrical on both sides. The figure below shows the typical shape of a normal distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Normal Distributions, as shown in the image above, follow the 68-95-99.7 rule:\n\nWithin one standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) of the mean \\(\\mu\\), lies 68.26% of the total area under the curve\nWithin 2 standard deviations \\(2 \\sigma\\) of the mean \\(\\mu\\), lies 95.44% of the total area under the curve\nIn fact, any amount of standard deviations \\(\\sigma\\), including decimals, is related to a specific percent of total area under the curve, for all normal distributions.\n\nThis is important, because the area under the distribution curve is the probability. Thus, the normal distribution tells us there is a relationship between the standard deviation and the probability of an action occurring.\nAny normal distribution can be described with 2 features: mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) in the following form: \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). For example, \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N} (30, 4)\\) means a normal distribution with mean 30 and variance 4.\nThe T distribution is a distribution very similar to the shape and size of the normal distribution, however, generally has thicker tails and a lower peak. The key difference is that t-distributions are defined with only one parameter - degrees of freedom \\(DF\\).\n\n\nCovariance and Correlation\nIn political economy, we are often interested in the relationship between two variables. For example, are oil producers more likely to be democratic? Are more educated voters more likely to turn out and vote? The relationship between two features, also called correlation, is the extent to which they tend to occur together.\n\nA positive correlation/relationship is when we are more likely to observe feature \\(Y\\), if feature \\(X\\) is present\nA negative correlation/relationship is when we are less likely to observe feature \\(Y\\), if feature \\(X\\) is present\nNo correlation/relationship is when we see feature \\(X\\), that does not tell us anything about the likelihood of observing \\(Y\\)\n\nWe can also visualise these graphically:\n\n\n\n\n\nCovariance is a way to measure the relationship between two variables. Covariance is the extent that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) vary together. Mathematically:\n\\[\nCov(X,Y) = \\sigma_{XY} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})\n\\]\nOr more simply:\n\nIn our data, we have many different pairs of data points \\((X_i, Y_i)\\)\n\\(X_i\\) is some value of \\(X\\), and \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the mean of \\(X\\). Same goes for \\(Y_i\\) and \\(\\bar{Y}\\)\nThus, \\(X_i - \\bar{X}\\) is the distance between any point \\(X_i\\) and the mean \\(\\bar{X}\\). Same goes for \\(Y_i - \\bar{Y}\\)\n\\(n\\) is the number of observations (data points) in our data\n\nWe can interpret the sign of the covariance: if it is positive, we have a positive relationship. if it is negative, we have a negative relationship. However, we cannot interpret the numerical value of the covariance.\nTo do that, we have to find the correlation coefficient. We calculate this by taking the covariance, and dividing it by the product of the standard deviation of \\(X\\) and the standard deviation of \\(Y\\). Mathematically:\n\\[\nCorr(X,Y) = r = \\frac{Cov(X,Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y}\n\\]\nThe correlation coefficient is always between -1 and 1.\n\nThe direction is the same as the covariance - if the coefficient is positive, then we have a positive relationship, vice versa.\nIf the correlation coefficient is closer to -1 or 1, it means a strong correlation. If the correlation is closer to 0, then it is a weak correlation\n\n\n\nBest Linear Predictor\nWhile the correlation coefficient tells us the strength of a correlation, it does not say anything about the magnitude of the relationship. For example, if \\(X\\) increases by one unit, how much does \\(Y\\) increase by? The correlation coefficient does not say.\n\nIn a linear model, the \\(X\\) variable is considered the explanatory or independent variable, while the \\(Y\\) is the response or dependent variable.\n\nMagnitude is quite an important concept. After all, even if two values are very highly correlated, if an increase of one unit in \\(X\\) only leads to a miniscule increase in \\(Y\\), this relationship might not be very important for understanding the world.\nA way to estimate the magnitude of the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is the best linear predictor. The best linear predictor is a best fit line for the data, that takes the form of a linear equation: \\(Y = \\alpha + \\beta X\\).\nIn this equation, the \\(\\beta\\) term in the best fit line is the slope of the linear equation. Essentially, it tells us for every increase in one unit of \\(X\\), how much do we expect \\(Y\\) to increase by?\n\nWe can interpret the sign of \\(\\beta\\): a positive \\(\\beta\\) is a positive relationship, a negative \\(\\beta\\) is a negative relationship, and \\(\\beta = 0\\) is no relationship.\nWe can also interpret the magnitude of \\(\\beta\\): as \\(X\\) increases by 1 unit, \\(Y\\) is expected to increase by \\(\\beta\\) units.\n\nThe Best Linear Predictor is a form of Linear Regression, the primary topic we will cover in the next two chapters."

    "section": "Parallel Trends Assumption",
    "text": "Parallel Trends Assumption\nThe parallel trends assumption states if a treated unit had hypothetically not been treated, they would have followed the same trend in the outcome variable as the untreated units. In the context of this study, if a municipality that had a palm-oil plantation hypothetically did not have a palm-oil plantation, the trend in displacement rate of civilians would be the same as the municipalities who did not have a palm-oil plantation. Tellez (2022) asserts that parallel trends in this study is conditional on two covariates: the presence of coca production, and the amount of left-wing guerrilla attacks in a municipality in a specific year.6\nA conventional way to test the parallel trends assumption is with a leads-and-lags test. From the reproduced interaction-weighted (Sun and Abraham 2021) dynamic treatment effects in figure 1 above, we can see that there are no statistically significant estimates (at p&lt;0.05) in the pre-treatment period. Thus, this test provides insufficient evidence of a violation of parallel trends.\nHowever, significance testing individual pre-treatment coefficients is not a sufficient approach to test for violations of parallel trends. We also have to consider the substantive size of the estimated deviations in the pre-treatment periods, as well as consider the joint significance of pre-treatment estimates (Liu et al, 2024).\nFigure 2 contains two of these pre-trend tests using the fixed effects counterfactual (FEct) estimator proposed by Liu, Xu, and Wang (2024).7 Imputation estimators like FEct generally have greater power in testing pre-trend deviations (Chiu et al 2025). FEct also allows the easy implementation of a joint-significance test (F-test) and a equivalence test (TOST) for substantive significance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe joint significance F-test of the pre-treatment coefficients checks if there is a significant pre-treatment differential trend: statistical significance indicates there is a differential trend. For this study, the p-value is insignificant for the last 5 pre-treatment years, thus we do not find evidence of violating the parallel trends assumption with this test.\nThe equivalence test (TOST) for substantive size of estimated deviations checks if the confidence intervals of estimates in the pre-treatment trend exceed an “equivalence” range around 0. The equivalence range is defined as 0.36 times the standard deviation of the outcome variable, after partialling out unit and time fixed effects. A significant result means the pre-treatment estimates are within the equivalence range. For this study, the p-value is insignificant, indicating evidence for a potential violation in parallel trends.\nNotably, it seems as the estimate in pre-treatment period -5 is abnormally high, while the others seem to be closer to 0. Since the pre-treatment period -5 is still 5 years before treatment, it may not be entirely relevant to the parallel trends between pre-treatment and post-treatment.8 Figure 3 re-runs the tests, this time only for 4 pre-treatment periods. The p-value for the F-test is higher, which is a good sign for meeting parallel trends. However, the study still fails the equivalence test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA notable choice the authors make is that they transform the outcome variable, rate of civilian displacement, with an inverse-sine transformation. Their theoretical justification for including an inverse-sine transformation is that it can make the outcome more normally distributed and reduce outliers. However, transformations affect the parallel trends assumption. Figure 4 contains the same parallel trends tests on a non-transformed outcome variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the non-transformed outcome variable passes both tests for the parallel trends assumption in 4 pre-treatment years. If parallel trends is met on the non-transformed outcome, that implies that parallel trends cannot be met on the inverse-sine transformed outcome (and vice versa).\nThis may suggest that Tellez would have been better off dealing with a non-transformed outcome variable. However, we also have to be careful about conditioning our analysis based off of if we pass the parallel trends test, as this can bias our ATT estimates (Roth, 2020). Another concern is that without the inverse-sine transformation, outliers are more influential, which increases the standard deviation of the outcome variable, thus increasing the range of equivalence in our test.9\nIt is important to note that pre-trend tests for parallel trends are not entirely reliable. Pre-trend tests tend to have less power than our main treatment effect estimates (Roth, 2020). Furthermore, the parallel trend that is essential to difference-in-differences is that of the potential outcome under control for the last pre-treatment and into the post-treatment periods. Since this involves unobserved counterfactuals for the treated units, the pre-trend test does not directly test if the relevant parallel trends needed for identification is met."

    "section": "No Anticipation and SUTVA",
    "text": "No Anticipation and SUTVA\nThe no anticipation assumption states that in the pre-treatment period(s), the observed outcome is equal to the potential outcome under control. Or in the context of this paper, it means that the displacement rate of a country in a pre-treatment year is not affected by the anticipation of palm-oil plantations in the future, before the palm-oil plantations have been established in that municipality.\nTellez (2022) does not justify that he meets this assumption in his paper. I believe there are theoretical reasons to believe that this assumption is not met. It seems plausible that it takes time to set up the necessary infrastructure and equipment to begin running a palm-oil plantation. That could imply that the land acquisition took place a decent period of time before the actual palm-oil plantation began operation.\nRecall that the causal theory of Tellez (2022) is regarding how land acquisition for palm-oil plantations drives displacement. If land acquisition occurs in the previous year before a palm-oil plantation began operation, it is plausible that the “true” treatment occurred in the year prior to the “recorded” treatment in the study. This would mean that the first pre-treatment period’s observed outcomes for treated units would not be their potential outcome under control, but rather the potential outcome under treatment, violating the no anticipation assumption. This could explain the noticable “jump” in difference between treated and untreated in pre-period -5, in both figures 1 and 2.\nIf anticipation is systematic, i.e. every treated municipality has the same length of pre-treatment anticipation, we could correct for it by changing the treatment variable to align with the anticipation period. However, adjusting for anticipation becomes more difficult if it varies between different municipalities. As I do not have enough theoretical expertise on the subject of palm-oil plantations in Colombia, it is hard for me to select a specific anticipation structure in which to adjust for.\nThere is also a completely opposite concern - that the opportunistic elites did not initiate land dispalcement until after palm-oil plantations were first established and proven to be profitable in a municipality. While I have no strong theoretical backing of this, the dynamic treatment effects from figure 1 (Sun and Abraham) seem to suggest the statistically significant causal results occurred in the 4th post-treatment period and onward. This could be considered more of a measurement problem - the choice of using the presence of the first palm-oil plantation as the treatment may not be properly approximating when local elites began to initiate forced displacement.\nThe stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) states that one unit’s treatment status does not affect the potential outcomes of another unit. Or in the context of this paper, one municipality getting (or not getting) a palm-oil plantation does not affect the displacement rate of other municipalities. SUTVA also states that treatments are consistent/identical across observations.\nTellez (2022) does not justify meeting this assumption. I believe there are theoretical reasons to believe this assumption is not met. For example, take neighboring municipalities. If one municipality starts to build land-intensive palm-oil plantations, according to the theoretical causal mechanism, that will cause forced displacement of citizens in that first municipality. Neighboring municipalities will see that municipality have large displacement of civilians. It is plausible that some civilians in the nearby municipalities will also fear for their safety, and flee. It is also plausible that the coercive tactics used by local elites and allied armed groups to acquire land in one municipality would have effects on neighboring citizens.\nIf this theoretical story is true, that creates issues with our potential outcomes framework. In the normal framework, the potential outcomes \\(Y_{it}(d)\\) only depend on unit \\(i\\)’s own treatment status \\(d\\). However, if the story above is plausible, the potential outcomes of unit \\(i\\) will now depend on not just unit \\(i\\)’s treatment status, but also unit \\(j\\)’s treatment status. This means our individual causal effect will no longer be \\(\\tau = Y_{it}(1) - Y_{it}(0)\\), which will invalidate the identification proof behind difference-in-differences.\nFurthermore, it is unlikely that the treatment of palm-oil plantations is stable/consistent/identical across units. After all, a series of massive palm-oil plantations in a municipality is very different than just one smaller palm-oil plantation. Tellez tries to address this in model (2) by interacting palm-oil production levels with treatment. However, Tellez only uses national aggregate palm-oil production data, which fails to capture the differences between municipalities, so this interaction is insufficient to deal with this issue."

However, in the literature review (p. 406), Tellez argues that “illegal crops” like coca that are grown on “small plots” tend to rarely effect displacement. This seems like a contradiction.↩︎\nI chose to use FEct instead of IFEct because IFEct’s inclusion of time-varying latent factors makes it more robust to parallel trends.
