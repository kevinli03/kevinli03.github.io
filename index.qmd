# **Hello!**

![](me.jpg){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

### About me

I am a student at the London School of Economics, studying for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economy. My interests relate to the use of statistics and formal mathematical modelling to study Political Science and Political Economy.

Prior to my MSc, I completed a BSc (Hons) in Politics from King's College London, receiving First Class Honours (US Equivalent: Summa Cum Laude). During my undergraduate degree, I also took summer courses in Data Science and Machine Learning at the London School of Economics.

<br />

My work experience includes two internships with the United Nations Development Programme. My first internship was with the Foresight Team within the Regional Bureau of Asia and the Pacific. There, I contributed to a publication on the potential effects of climate migration on Pakistan and Vietnam, and helped draft potential policy solutions. I, along with my colleagues, organised an online consultation with local stakeholders in Pakistan and Vietnam to facilitate inclusive policy-making.

My second internship was with the inclusive growth team of the Bureau for Programme and Policy Support. There, I contributed to a publication on UNDP's effectiveness in promoting the Samoa Plan of Action for Small Islands and Developing States (SIDS). I also worked on a database of "best practices" regarding UNDP social protection programmes.

<br />

I am originally from San Diego, California, but I have now spent the last 3 years of my life in London. Outside of my academic interests and work, my hobbies include watching Basketball and Football, playing the Violin and Piano, and studying linguistics and creating constructed languages.

Also, fun fact (also a little bit of a brag), but I was offered a place on the MPhil Politics and International Studies programme at the University of Cambridge. I ended up choosing the London School of Economics over Cambridge, mainly because my interests lie in Political Economy and economic methods in studying politics.

<br />

This is my personal website. I don't really have a purpose for this site, besides using it to post some of my accomplishments or what I find interesting!

### Political Economy Short Books Series

This is a series of 4 short books I created to consolidate all the information I have learned into one place.

**NOTE: THESE ARE IN PROGRESS** - they are being continuously updated, and are not final

1.  [An Introduction to Political Economy](https://kevinli03.github.io/politicaleconomy.pdf): This book covers how economic models and formal mathematical models can be applied to the study of political phenomena.
2.  [Introductory Econometrics for Political Economy](https://kevinli03.github.io/econometrics.pdf): This book focuses on the key techniques of econometrics/statistics for research in Political Economy and the social sciences more broadly, covering statistical inference, regression, and causal inference techniques.
3.  [Advanced Econometrics for Political Economy](https://kevinli03.github.io/advanced.pdf): This book focuses on advanced techniques of econometrics/statistics for research in Political Economy and the social sciences more broadly. Topics include machine learning prediction methods, multivariate analysis, latent variable modelling, time series analysis, and quantitative text mining.

-   Finally, a companion book: [Essential Mathematics for Political Economy](https://kevinli03.github.io/maths.pdf)

### Varieties of Capitalism and Tax Dataset

-   <https://github.com/kevinli03/VocTaxDataset>

-   This is a dataset that I created on the Varieties of Capitalism Framework (Political Economy) for an undergraduate paper. It includes OECD countries, their respective Variety of Capitalism as defined by the Varieties of Capitalism Framework, and relevant tax levels and economic data on the countries.
