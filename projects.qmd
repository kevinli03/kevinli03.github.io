# My Projects

### 2024 Presidential Elections

These are some (quick) predictions I made for the 2024 Presidential Elections using Random Forest/Bagging models, a few days before the election. I did correctly predict the winner!

### Varieties of Capitalism and Tax Dataset

This is a dataset that I created on the Varieties of Capitalism Framework (Political Economy) for an undergraduate paper. It includes OECD countries, their respective Variety of Capitalism as defined by the Varieties of Capitalism Framework, and relevant tax levels and economic data on the countries.
