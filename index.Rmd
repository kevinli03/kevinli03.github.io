**Hello!**

I am a student at the London School of Economics, studying for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economy. My interests relate to the use of quantitative methods and data to evaluate phenomena in the field of Political Economy.

Prior to my MSc, I completed a BSc (Hons) in Politics from King's College London, receiving First Class Honours (US Equivalent: Summa Cum Laude). During my undergraduate degree, I also took summer courses in Data Science and Machine Learning at the London School of Economics.

One of my main hobbies is using statistics to evaluate NBA player impact. The gold standard of impact, RAPM data, is only available since 1997. I enjoy creating predictive models of RAPM using common box score statistics, which can be retroactively applied to players pre-1997. I also enjoy making predictive models of elections. Aside from my statistical hobbies, I also enjoy playing the Violin and Piano, watching (association) football, and learning about linguistics.

This is my personal website. I don't really have a purpose for this site, besides using it to post some of my accomplishments or what I find interesting!
