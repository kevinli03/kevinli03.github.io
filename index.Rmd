**Hello!**

I am a student at the London School of Economics, studying for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economy. My interests relate to the use of quantitative methods and data to evaluate phenomena in the field of Political Economy. More specifically, I am interested in the use of statistical learning and machine learning to model political phenomena and analyse textual data.

Prior to my MSc, I completed a BSc (Hons) in Politics from King's College London, receiving First Class Honours (US Equivalent: Summa Cum Laude). During my undergraduate degree, I also took summer courses in Data Science and Machine Learning at the London School of Economics.

One of my main hobbies is using statistics to evaluate NBA player impact. The gold standard of impact, RAPM data, is only available since 1997. I enjoy creating predictive models of RAPM using common box score statistics, which can be retroactively applied to players pre-1997. I also enjoy making predictive models of elections. Aside from my statistical hobbies, I also enjoy playing the Violin and Piano, watching (association) football, and learning about linguistics.

This is my personal website. I don't really have a purpose for this site, besides using it to post some of my accomplishments or what I find interesting!

## Projects

**Political Science - Quantitative Methods in R Handbook**

-   <http://politicalscience.github.io>

-   This is a handbook I created to help fellow classmates implement political science statistical techniques in R.

**Varieties of Capitalism and Tax Dataset**

-   <https://github.com/kevinli03/VocTaxDataset>

-   This is a dataset that I created on the Varieties of Capitalism Framework (Political Economy) for an undergraduate paper. It includes OECD countries, their respective Variety of Capitalism as defined by the Varieties of Capitalism Framework, and relevant tax levels and economic data on the countries.

**TIE (Tree Impact Estimate) Advanced Statistic for NBA**

-   [link goes here] (Currently being updated)

-   This is my attempt to create an advanced statistic for the impact of NBA players. The gold standard of impact, RAPM data, is only available since 1997.

-   To get a metric we can compare current players to players prior to 1997, we need to use box-score stats available prior to 1997, and create models using those stats that predict RAPM.

-   I used common box-score statistics to train a model that predicts RAPM, so we can compare players after 1997 and prior to 1997.

-   I used tree-based Random Forest methods to approximate RAPM, hence the "Tree" in the title of the metric.

**2024 US Presidential Election Prediction Model**

-   This is a model I created in an attempt to predict the 2024 US Presidential Election popular vote share.

-   NOTE: This is something I did quickly in my free time. It is not meant to be an incredibly accurate model, so please, don't judge me if I got things completely wrong, and don't use this for betting.
