# **Predictions**

Disclamer: i collected all the data and ran all this models in like 2 hours. I did not put much effort into this, its not very good. Just for fun. Might add ridge regression later but lazy.

-   Very low sample size as well - just 22 presidential elections included as training data.
-   Also, this is a very unique presidential election - may be flawed to assume that past data can predict what will happen this time.

**DONT FORGET TO NOT ONLY CHECK OUT ELECTORAL VOTE PREDICTIONS, BUT ALSO THE YES/NO PREDICTIONS.**

-   Those models have a 100% accuracy in the last 7 elections, including the 2016 and 2020 elections. Use the navbar or scroll down to find them!

## Electoral Votes Predictions

6 Models sorted roughly based on performance in last 7 elections, but my model is trained on 22 presidential elections.

-   As an input, I put Harris with a +1.2 lead in polls, as was the case on 538 and 270 to win on 2 Nov.

Aggregate Prediction of All Models: Harris 241 Electoral College Votes, [Trump 297 Electoral College Votes]{.underline}.

<br />

**Random Forest (20 Variables Boostrap Sampled) with Heigh**t: Harris 223.542 Electoral Votes, [trump 314.458]{.underline}

(Quite Accurate, all numbers are electoral college votes of the incumbent party going into the election - ex. this year democrats are incumbent)

## Win/Lose Probability Predictions

Note: Every model in this section correctly predicts the election winners of the last 7 elections.

Do not pay too much attention to the acutal percentages - the estimation can be bizzare. [NOTE that this year, the percentages are far closer than previous years, indicating a close race]{.underline}.

## My Personal (Gut-Based) Predictions

**My Personal Map**

![](map.png)

<br />

## The Data in My Models

I used the following variables (that I gathered in like one hour). I did not check data quality, could be terrible.

1.  Year
2.  Incumbent Party
3.  Reelection (is on of the candidates the current president)
4.  Terms current party is in office continuously
5.  Poll margin (incumbent party candidate- challenger)
6.  Real GDP Growth in election year
7.  Unemployment rate in election rate
8.  Inflation rate in election year
9.  Incumbent party president average approval rating (gallup)
10. Incumbent party president highest approval rating (gallup)
11. Incumbent party president lowest approval rating (gallup)
12. Recession occurred in the past 4 years?
13. House net change in seats (of incumbent party) during the midterm election 2 years before the election
14. House net change in seats (of incumbent party) during the election 4 years ago
15. House change in seats (of incumbent party) for both midterm and 4 year ago election combined.
16. Incumbent party faced a primary challenge? (challenge defined as winner of primary recieved less than 60% of votes. I classify harris is no-primary challenge).
17. S&P 500 Returns in election year
18. Midterm house elections from 2 years ago, incumbent party's vote share overall (entire country)
19. \% Change in Jobs from last election to this election (a full presidential term)
20. Height of the candidates (incumbent - challenger)
21. Real estate returns in election year
22. Treasury 10-year bond returns in election year.
23. Does incumbent party have majority in House?
24. Does incumbent party have majority in Senate?
25. How many workers were furloughed as a result of a government shutdown during the current administration?
26. Did any of the 15 largest tax rises in history occur during the current administration? If so, how much was the tax rise (% wise)
27. Did any of the 15 largest tax breaks in history occur during the current administration? If so, how much was the tax break (% wise)
28. The last two data points but net.
