# My Publications

### Co-Authored

Rubian, Renata, Dajna Sorenson, Rishi Chakraborty, Kevin Li, and Jade Cooper. “[SIDS: Looking Back and Forward – Accelerating Action in the Next 10 Years.](https://www.undp.org/publications/sids-looking-back-and-forward){style="color: gray;"}” *United Nations Development Programme*, (May 2024).

I co-authored this report while working with the Inclusive Growth team in the Bureau of Policy and Programme Support at the United Nations Development Programme. This report investigates and reports the impact that the UNDP's programmes and policies had on the development of small island and developing states between 2014 and 2024.
